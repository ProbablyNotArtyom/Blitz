SnapGear SME HOWTO
------------------

The SnapGear/SME router products are based on the Hitachi SuperH RISC
processor. You will need an appropriate sh-linux configured gcc compiler
and tools to compile it. SnapGear currently uses binutils-2.12.90 and
gcc-3.0.4.

The build only supports the linux-2.4.x kernel using uClibc as the library,
so you select those during configuration.

To load images into the flash you can use the firmware upgrade option of
the web pages, or you can load it from the command line using:

    netflash A.B.C.D imagez.bin

Where A.B.C.D is the address of your TFTP server holding the generated
imagez.bin file.
