Motorola M5206eLITE Evaluation Board
------------------------------------

The Motorola 5206eLITE board comes as standard with 1MB static RAM, and no
ethernet network support. You will need to use the small image on a standard
board. Loading the image can only be done over the serial port of the eLITE,
so you will need to get the S-Record format images.

Both the linux-2.0.x and linux-2.4.x kernels are supported, and both the
uC-libc and uClibc libraries as well. (Note that glibc is *not* supported
on this target).

The build process results in a file, images/image.bin, that can be loaded
into the M5206eLITE board.

To load using the serial port download: 

    dl 0x30020000

At this point you will need to instruct your terminal emulator to send the
file image.srec over the serial line. How to do this varies between different
terminal emulators, so consult your software's documentation if unsure.

To start the image use:

    go 0x30020000

The serial port console is configured to be the first ColdFire UART. On the
Motorola 5206eLITE board this is the same port as dBUG runs on. uClinux
configures this serial port for 19200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop
bit (the same as the dBUG default). Once you issue the go command (above)
you should see the kernel boot to an interactive shell.
