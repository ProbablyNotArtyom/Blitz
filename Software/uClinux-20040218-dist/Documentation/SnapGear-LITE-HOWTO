SnapGear LITE HOWTO
-------------------

The SnapGear/LITE and SnapGear/LITE+ router products are based on the
Motorola 5272 ColdFire processor. You use the standard uClinux m68k-elf
tool chain for them.

You can build either linux-2.0.x or linux-2.4.x kernels. Choose the
uC-libc library.

To load images into the flash you can use the firmware upgrade option of
the web pages, or you can load it from the command line using:

    netflash A.B.C.D imagez.bin

Where A.B.C.D is the address of your TFTP server holding the generated
imagez.bin file.

After reboot, and while the power is on, press the erase/reboot button,
hold in for approximately 1 second. This will clear any old configuration.
Now you can telnet to device; login is "root", password "default".
