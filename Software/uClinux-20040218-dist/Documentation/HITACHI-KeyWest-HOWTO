Hitachi KeyWest
---------------

The Hitachi/KeyWest target uses the Hitachi SuperH 7729 processor.
To build for this target you will need a working sh-linux- tool chain.

The linux-2.4.x kernel should be used and either glibc or uClibc.

When you have finished compiling you can load the image using DMON
with:

	* set SW1 to OFF-ON-ON-OFF
	* reset the board (DMON should appear)
	* load the image through the network with

	  DMON> le 0

	* enter the IP for the board,  the IP of your TFTP server
	  and the name of the file to load (sh.srec)

	* Once the board has finished loading the image,  start it by running

	  DMON> g 8C002000
