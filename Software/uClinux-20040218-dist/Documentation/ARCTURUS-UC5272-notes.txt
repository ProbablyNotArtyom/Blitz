 This patch is the start of a project to get the Arcturus uC5272 supported in
 the latest distribution.

 This is an "early access" release and is not supported in any way.
 However please send me information of any bug fixes etc.

 This device will support a Cramfs file system but the initial patch
 does not cover this feature.
 Later work will be introduced to cover that option if I have time.


 The system, after patching, should produce an image.bin in the images
 directory.

 Using the serial download technique the uC5272 should run a single user
 mode linux ( no login ).
 (if you include /etc/passwd it should run agetty and ask for a login).


 This distribution has been configured to use uClibc and busybox extensively.

 Some Arcturus tools like printbenv and setbenv are not yet included.
 The uCbootstrap interface is included.
