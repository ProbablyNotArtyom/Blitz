The uClinux GBA support is very much a work in progress. It is not
100% complete.

Currently I have only used it on emulators, not real hardware.
And it does not yet boot all the way to a shell prompt. It
does try to launch is first application though (sash shell).
I have no ETA for a finish of the port, it is very much on the
back burner for me right now.

The GBA support is in the uClinux-2.0.x kernel only, and I have only
ever built it against uC-libc.

The best emulator I have found is Mappy, although I also use
BoycottAdvance for some development too. I found the emulators
still a little wanting when running real operating system code
like uClinux. Hopefully they will get better with time.

You will also need to use a custom BIOS that redirects interrupts
through RAM. If you want mine send me an email and I will send
it too you.
