Q: During the link process I get error messages like:

/usr/local/bin/m68k-elf-ld.real: address 0x1069fe of linux section .bss is not
within region ram

or:

/usr/local/m68k-elf/bin/ld.real: region flatmem is full (../../bin/xxxx.elf
section .bss)

A: This can be caused by a missconfiguration of the linker description file 
(1st
example)as well as by your program exceeding the maximum size (2nd example). 
The
linker description file for the kernel can be found under the ./arch directory
for your specific architecture. It's name is 'ram.ld'. If your application is
getting to large - or the default setting of 1 MB is to sparse :) - you might
want to fiddle around with 'elf2flt.ld' within your toolchain's path. A
description of the linker file syntax can be found at ???(Greg?).


Q: What do I need to mount NFS

A: In the Kernel you have to enable

* your network device (should be the default)
* TCP/IP Networking (should be the default)
* File systems -> Network file systems -> NFS File system support
* you might need NFSv3 support (for a SuSE 7.3 server you do)

In the userland:

* Network->Applications->portmap (recommended)
* the mount / unmount command from Filesystem Applications or the BusyBox

Now you can call:

  mount -t nfs 192.168.0.1:/myexport /mnt -o nolock

To mount a share without the portmapper. If you forget the nolock option the
command will block. If you have the portmapper call:

  portmap &
  mount -t nfs 192.168.0.1:/myexport /mnt
