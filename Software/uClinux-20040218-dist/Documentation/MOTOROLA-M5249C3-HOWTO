Motorola M5249C3 Evaluation Board
---------------------------------

The new Motorola M5249C3 development board comes with 8MB SDRAM, and uses
an SMSC91c111 10/100 Mb ethernet part. The default uClinux configuration
includes an ethernet driver for this device.

Both the linux-2.0.x and linux-2.4.x kernels are supported, and both the
uC-libc and uClibc libraries as well. (Note that glibc is *not* supported
on this target).

The build process results in a file, images/image.bin, that can be loaded
into the M5249C3 board using the builtin dBUG firmware.

To load using the ethernet network download: 

    dn -i image.bin

To start up the image use: 

    go 0x20000

The serial port console is configured to be the first ColdFire UART. On the
M5249C3 board this is the same serial port that dBUG runs on. Its is the
port labeled "Terminal". uClinux/Coldfire configures this port for 19200
baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit. You should see the kernel boot
messages come out on this port, and uClinux/Coldfire will boot to an
interactive Linux shell. 

You could also use the serial port download. The serial download is slow,
it will take several minutes to load the image. You must use an S-record
format binary when loading over the serial line. (You can use
m68k-elf-objcopy to convert the binary file to S-Record format.)
