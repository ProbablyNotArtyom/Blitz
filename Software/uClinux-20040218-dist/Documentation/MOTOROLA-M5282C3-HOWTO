Motorola M5282C3 Evaluation Board
---------------------------------

The Motorola M5282C3 board comes standard with 8MB SDRAM, builint 10/100 Mb
ethernet controller, 512kB of internal flash, and a host of other builtin
peripherals.

Only the linux-2.4.x kernel is supported, and both the uC-libc and uClibc
libraries as well. (Note that glibc is *not* supported on this target).

The build process results in a file, images/image.bin, that can be loaded
into the M5282C3 board using the builtin dBUG firmware.

To load using the ethernet network download: 

    dn -i image.bin

To start up the image use: 

    go 0x10000

The serial port console is configured to be the first ColdFire UART. On the
M5282C3 board this is the same serial port that dBUG runs on. Its is the
port labeled "Terminal". uClinux/Coldfire configures this port for 19200
baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit. You should see the kernel boot
messages come out on this port, and uClinux/Coldfire will boot to an
interactive Linux shell. 

You could also use the serial port download. The serial download is slow,
it will take several minutes to load the image. You must use an S-record
format binary when loading over the serial line. (You can use
m68k-elf-objcopy to convert the binary file to S-Record format.)
