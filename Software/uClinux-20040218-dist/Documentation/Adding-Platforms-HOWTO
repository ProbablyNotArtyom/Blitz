About this document
-------------------

This document describes the steps I took to add the support of our
COBRA5272 board to the uClinux-dist-20020306. I'm shure I've missed
something. So if you find errors or have other things to add, please
feel free to email me.

Introduction
------------

Our board is quite comparable to the Motorola M5272C3 eval
board. So I could use their structure as a starting point.
HINT: Currently I only implemented support in the kernel 2.4.x
tree!

Steps I did
-----------

1. I unpacked the original distribution:
(tar -zxvf uClinux-dist-20020306.tar.gz)

2. I introduced the board in linux-2.4.x/arch/m68knommu/Boards.mk:
...
ifdef CONFIG_M5272
PLATFORM := 5272
...
+ifdef CONFIG_COBRA5272
+BOARD := senTec
+endif
endif
...

3. Now I set some defines in linux-2.4.x/arch/m68knommu/config.in:
...
if [ "$CONFIG_M5272" = "y" ]; then
...
+  bool 'senTec CORA5272 board support' CONFIG_COBRA5272
   bool 'ROMFS image not RAM resident' CONFIG_ROMFS_FROM_ROM
fi
...
         HIMEM  CONFIG_HIMEMKERNEL" ROM
+
+if [ "$CONFIG_COBRA5272" = "y" ]; then
+  bool 'Compiled-in Kernel Boot Parameter' CONFIG_BOOTPARAM
+  if [ "$CONFIG_BOOTPARAM" = "y" ]; then
+    string 'Kernel Boot Parameter' \
+      CONFIG_BOOTPARAM_STRING "CONSOLE=/dev/ttyS0,19200  root=1f00"
+  fi
+fi

4. Next step was to create our own platform directory in
linux-2.4.x/arch/m68knommu/platform/5272/senTec/ and
to create/modify the crt0_ram.S and ram.ld there accordingly. 
I could do:
...
cd uClinux-dist/linux-2.4.x/arch/m68knommu/platform/5272/
cp -a MOTOROLA/ senTec
vim senTec/crt0_ram.S # modify the file
vim senTec/ram.ld # modify the file
...

5. Then I created vendors/senTec/COBRA5272/ under the uClinux-dist
directory, and added Makefile, config.arch, config.linux-2.4.x and
config.vendor-2.4.x there.

6. I had to change linux-2.4.x/arch/m68knommu/platform/5272/config.c
to get some options working, but that is an optional step!

Some final words
----------------

After doing these few steps I could compile uClinux for our board and
run the image. Some other things that I did to get support of some
features (for instance MTD/JFFS) I don't want to describe in this
document. I hope I will have the time to write some other documents
for that.
One basic rule for all changes you do should be:
If you can, do some "#ifdef CONFIG_YourArch" around your changes to
keep unwanted effects on other platforms at a minimum!

Feedback
--------

As you easily may find out I'm not a native English speaker. So:
If you find errors or have suggestions, questions or what ever, 
please feel free to email me at linux@sentec-elektronik.de.

With kind regards
