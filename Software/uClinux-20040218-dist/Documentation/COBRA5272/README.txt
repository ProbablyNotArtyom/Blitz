1  Introduction

This is the top level of the directory structure with documents about
our COBRA5272 board.

2  The board

The senTec COBRA5272 is a board based on the Motorola ColdFire 5272.
I've implemented our board into the uClinux distribution of Lineo
(http://www.uclinux.org/).

3	Structure of the documentation directory

You can find some basic documents in English under ./en. Currently we
just have a Getting-Started and a (very small) FAQ. I hope I can write
some more docu in the near future.

4	Home of COBRA5272

If you are interested in our board, you can order it at
http://www.elektronikladen.de/cobra5272.html. The home page is at
http://www.sentec-elektronik.de/cobra/. (HINT: This pages are
currently only available in German! If you need some assistence in
English, please see below under "Feedback"!). At the homepage you will

more.
