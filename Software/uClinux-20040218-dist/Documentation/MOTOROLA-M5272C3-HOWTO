Motorola M5272C3 Evaluation Board
---------------------------------

There are two variations of the Motorola M5272C3 development board. The
earlier boards came with 4MB of RAM, and use an Intel LevelOne PHY with the
builint in 10/100 Mb ethernet. The later revision boards have 16MB of RAM,
and use an ADMtek PHY with the internal ethernet. uClinux is configured by
default to use 4MB or RAM, which will work on either board. The PHY type
is detected and set appropriately by the FEC ethernet driver.

Both the linux-2.0.x and linux-2.4.x kernels are supported, and both the
uC-libc and uClibc libraries as well. (Note that glibc is *not* supported
on this target).

The build process results in a file, images/image.bin, that can be loaded
into the M5272C3 board using the builtin dBUG firmware.

To load using the ethernet network download: 

    dn -i image.bin

To start up the image use: 

    go 0x20000

The serial port console is configured to be the first ColdFire UART. On the
M5272C3 board this is the same serial port that dBUG runs on. Its is the
port labeled "Terminal". uClinux/Coldfire configures this port for 19200
baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit. You should see the kernel boot
messages come out on this port, and uClinux/Coldfire will boot to an
interactive Linux shell. 

You could also use the serial port download. The serial download is slow,
it will take several minutes to load the image. You must use an S-record
format binary when loading over the serial line. (You can use
m68k-elf-objcopy to convert the binary file to S-Record format.)
