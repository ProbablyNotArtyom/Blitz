uClinux on the LEON TSIM Simulator
----------------------------------

To compile for the SPARC LEON TSIM simulator you will first need to get a
sparc-elf toolchain. You can get a pre-built package on uclinux.org at:

  http://www.uclinux.org/pub/uClinux/sparc-elf-tools/

Othwerwise you can generate your own using binutils and gcc.

To build uClinux for TSIM simply choose the LEOX/TSIM target when configuring.
You can only select the linux-2.0.x kernel and uC-libc library. There is no
support for linux-2.4.x kernels, uClibc or glibc libaries.

The make process will ultimately build an images/image.bin file.
This can be run directly with tsim:

    tsim images/image.elf

Then use the "c" continue command to run it.
