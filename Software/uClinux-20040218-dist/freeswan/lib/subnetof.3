.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions are obsolete; see
.IR ipsec_networkof (3)
for their replacements.
.PP
.I Subnetof
takes an Internet
.I address
and a subnet
.I mask
and returns the network part of the address
(all in network byte order).
.I Hostof
similarly returns the host part, and
.I broadcastof
returns the broadcast address (all-1s convention) for the network.
.PP
These functions are provided to hide the Internet bit-munging inside
an API, in hopes of easing the eventual transition to IPv6.
.SH SEE ALSO
inet(3), ipsec_atosubnet(3)
.SH HISTORY
Written for the FreeS/WAN project by Henry Spencer.
.SH BUGS
Calling functions for this is more costly than doing it yourself.
