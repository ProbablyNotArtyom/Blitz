.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions provide information on version numbering and copyright
of the Linux FreeS/WAN IPsec implementation.
.PP
.I Ipsec_version_code
returns a pointer to a string constant
containing the current IPsec version code,
such as ``1.92'' or ``snap2001Nov19b''.
.PP
.I Ipsec_version_string
returns a pointer to a string constant giving a full version identification,
consisting of the version code preceded by a prefix identifying the software,
e.g. ``Linux FreeS/WAN 1.92''.
.PP
.I Ipsec_copyright_notice
returns a pointer to a vector of pointers,
terminated by a
.BR NULL ,
which is the text of a suitable copyright notice.
Each pointer points to a string constant (possibly empty) which is one line
of the somewhat-verbose copyright notice.
The strings are NUL-terminated and do not contain a newline;
supplying suitable line termination for the output device is
the caller's responsibility.
