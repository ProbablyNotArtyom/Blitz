The only changes made to these files for use in FreeS/WAN are:

 - In zconf.h, macros are defined to prefix global symbols with "ipcomp_"
   (or "_ipcomp"), when compiled with -DIPCOMP_PREFIX.
 - The copyright strings are defined local (static)

 The above changes are made to avoid name collisions with ppp_deflate
 and ext2compr.

 - Files not needed for FreeS/WAN have been removed

 See the "README" file for information about where to obtain the complete
 zlib package.
