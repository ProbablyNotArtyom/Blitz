               * IPSEC for Linux, Preliminary Release *
               ****************************************



1. Files

The contents of net/ipsec/ (see below) join the linux kernel source tree.
as provided for higher up.

The utils/ directory contains the user-level utilities which you need
to run IPSEC.  See the top-level top/INSTALL to compile and install them.

The test/ directory contains test scripts.

The doc/ directory contains -- what else -- documentation.  Not a lot
of it, yet.

1.3. Test files

The test scripts are somewhat specific to site at the moment, but they will
be changed to be more general and generic soon.

The following are found in test/:

		between two machines.  MAC's must be changed for your setup.
snoop110-105	Script for starting a modified tcpdump to monitor traffic
		between two machines.  MAC's must be changed for your setup.


The following are found in test/100:

103	Script to setup IPSEC connections with (192.168.2.) 103.
