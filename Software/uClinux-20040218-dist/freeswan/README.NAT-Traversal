===================================  [                  http://www.arkoon.net ]
                                     [          http://open-source.arkoon.net ]

NAT-Traversal patch allows FreeS/WAN to be used behind any NAT device
by encapsuling ESP in UDP.

Send all your comments/requests to me (mlafon@arkoon.net). If you use it and
find it useful, drop me a mail too.

Notes :
-------

  o Transport mode has been disabled due to security concerns (see below for
    details).  Enable it AT YOUR OWN RISK.

  o Using Tunnel mode with roadwarriors, you will need to specify the internal
    IP in the FreeS/WAN Configuration or use Virtual IP (see below).
      ex:
        right=%any
        rightsubnet=192.168.1.1/32

  o x509/RSA is strongly recomended for authentication or you'll have to use
    the same PSK for every users.

  o This patch also includes VendorID identification. If you know/encounter
    other VendorID values/hash, please send them to me.

  o draft-ietf-ipsec-nat-t-ike-01 (used by SSH-Sentinel and SafeNet) does
    not work if the NAT-Device is doing Ipsec PassThrough.


Virtual IP :
------------

  This patch also include a method to allow roadwarriors to 'choose' their
  IP in a list of allowed networks.

  For each connection, you can allow roadwarrior to choose their IP
  following different methods :
    ...
    right=%any
    rightsubnet=vhost:%no,%priv
    ...

  virtual subnet is a network type (vhost or vnet) followed by a list of
  method :
    %no    = no virtual IP (accept public IP)
    %dhcp = accept DHCP SA (0.0.0.0/0) of affected IP  [not implemented]
    %ike  = accept affected IKE Config Mode IP         [not implemented]
    %priv = accept system-wide private net list
    %v4:x = accept ipv4 in list 'x'
    %v6:x = accept ipv6 in list 'x'
    %all  = accept all ips                             [only for testing]

  The system-wide private net list is define in the 'config setup' section
  and contain a list of allowed networks and a list of not allowed networks.

  The recommended value is all RFC1918 private networks minus your own
  private networks.

  By example (RFC1918 - 192.168.2.0/24 - 192.168.15.128/25) :
    virtual_private=%v4:10.0.0.0/8,%v4:172.16.0.0/12,%v4:192.168.0.0/16,%v4:!192.168.2.0/24,%v4:!192.168.15.128/25

  Note: you can also use subnetwithin from the x509 patch to handle virtual IP.


Install :
---------

  o apply NAT-T patch in freeswan directory :

    - FreeS/WAN 1.99:
        NAT-Traversal-0.6-freeswan-1.99.diff

    - FreeS/WAN 1.99 + NotifyDelete + x509 0.9.15 + Alg 0.8.0 :
        NAT-Traversal-0.6-freeswan-1.99-nd-x509-0.9.15-alg.diff

    - FreeS/WAN 1.99 + NotifyDelete + x509 0.9.31 + Alg 0.8.0 :
        NAT-Traversal-0.6-freeswan-1.99-nd-x509-0.9.31-alg.diff

    - FreeS/WAN 2.00 + x509 1.3.5 :
        NAT-Traversal-0.6-freeswan-2.00-x509-1.3.5.diff

    - Super FreeS/WAN 2.00-rc3 :
        NAT-Traversal-0.6-sfs-2.00rc3.diff

    $ cd ~/dev/freeswan-1.99/
    $ cat ~/NAT-Traversal-0.6-freeswan-1.99.diff | patch -p1

  o Follow the FreeS/WAN procedure to rebuild all. When doing kernel
    configuration, don't forget to select CONFIG_IPSEC_NAT_TRAVERSAL.

  o install new kernel, pluto, whack, _confread, _plutorun, _realsetup
  o add 'nat_traversal=yes' to your ipsec.conf (config setup)
  o reboot with the new kernel


Tests (only Tunnel Mode) :
--------------------------

  o SSH Sentinel 1.3         [ nat-t-ike-01 ]  : OK
  o SSH Sentinel 1.3.1       [ nat-t-ike-01 ]  : OK
  o SSH Sentinel 1.4         [ nat-t-ike-01 ]  : OK
  o SafeNet SoftRemote 8.0   [ nat-t-ike-01 ]  : OK
  o FreeS/WAN + NAT-T        [ nat-t-ike-01 ]  : OK
  o FreeS/WAN + NAT-T        [ nat-t-ike-03 ]  : OK

Note:
  SSH Sentinel has a bug during diagnostic. It sends ENCAPSULATION_MODE_TUNNEL
  instead of ENCAPSULATION_MODE_UDP_TUNNEL. This is not refused to allow good
  interoperability with SSH but will be removed as soon as Sentinel is fixed.
  If you don't want this behavior, you can add this line in spdb.c :
  > #define I_DONT_CARE_OF_SSH_SENTINEL


Security Concerns :
-------------------

  o Transport Mode can't be used without NAT in the IPSec layer. Otherwise,
    all packets for the NAT device (including all hosts behind it) would be
    sent to the NAT-T Client. This would create a sort of blackhole between
    the peer which is not behind NAT and the NAT device.

  o In Tunnel Mode with roadwarriors, we CAN'T accept any IP address,
    otherwise, an evil roadwarrior could redirect all trafic for one host
    (including a host on the private network) to himself. That's why, you have
    to specify the private IP in the configuration file, use virtual IP
    management, or DHCP-over-IPSec.


Todo :
------

  o accept new NAT mapping with different IP address
  o smaller patch for net/ipv4/udp.c (?)
  o do not send keep alive if packets have been sent to peer (?)
