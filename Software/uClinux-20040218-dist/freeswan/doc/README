This directory has the HTML FreeS/WAN documentation.

Start from either of:

	toc.html	table of contents for HTML docs
	index.html	pointers to everything, including
			 text files not in HTML docs

The Makefile in this directory can generate various
things from the HTML source:

	./*.html	individual HTML files
			with previous/contents/next links
	toc.html	table of contents
	HowTo.html	one big HTML file
	HowTo.ps	Postscript
	HowTo.pdf	PDF
	HowTo.txt	ASCII text

Not all of the above are in the shipped version. All but
text are on our website, www.freeswan.org. To get PDF or
Postscript, either grab them from the web or install
htmldoc from www.easysw.com, then use the Makefile.

Subdirectories are:
	src/*.html		HTML source files
	manpage.d/*.html	HTML versions of man pages

You should not need to look at these, except for following
links to HTML man pages.

The Internet Drafts are natively in XML format. They have been 
converted with Marshall Rose's xml2rfc.

xml2rfc is available at xml.resource.org. 
You may have to install the TclXML package by symlinking it into
/usr/lib/tcl8.3 or some such.
