<DT><A name="3DES"><A name="0">3DES (Triple DES)</A></A></DT>
<DD>Using three <A href="#DES">DES</A> encryptions on a single data 
 block, with at least two different keys, to get higher security than 
 is available from a single DES pass. The three-key version of 3DES is 
 the default encryption algorithm for <A href="web.html#FreeSWAN">Linux 
 FreeS/WAN</A>. </DD>
<P><A href="#IPSEC">IPSEC</A> always does 3DES with three different 
 keys, as required by RFC 2451. For an explanation of the two-key 
 variant, see <A href="#2key">two key triple DES</A>. Both use an <A href="#EDE">
EDE</A> encrypt-decrypt-encrpyt sequence of  operations.</P>
<P>Single <A href="#DES">DES</A> is <A href="politics.html#desnotsecure">
insecure</A>.</P>
<P>Double DES is ineffective. Using two 56-bit keys, one might expect 
 an attacker to have to do 2<SUP>112</SUP> work to break it. In fact, 
 only 2<SUP>57</SUP> work is required with a <A href="#meet">
meet-in-the-middle attack</A>, though a large amount of  memory is also 
required. Triple DES is vulnerable to a similar attack,  but that just 
reduces the work factor from the 2<SUP>168</SUP> one  might expect to 2<SUP>
112</SUP>. That provides adequate protection  against <A href="#brute">
brute force</A> attacks, and no better attack  is known.</P>
<P>3DES can be somewhat slow compared to other ciphers. It requires 
 three DES encryptions per block. DES was designed for hardware 
 implementation and includes some operations which are difficult in 
 software. However, the speed we get is quite acceptable for many uses.

block cipher</A> standard to replace <A href="politics.html#desnotsecure">
DES</A> being developed by <A href="#NIST">NIST</A>, the US National 
Institute of Standards and  Technology. DES used 64-bit blocks and a 
56-bit key. AES ciphers use a  128-bit block and are required to 
support 128, 192 and 256-bit keys.  Some of them support other sizes as 
well. The larger block size helps  resist <A href="#birthday">birthday 
attacks</A> while the large key  size prevents <A href="#brute">brute 
force attacks</A>. </DD>
<P>Fifteen proposals meeting NIST's basic criteria were submitted in 
 1998 and subjected to intense discussion and analysis, &quot;round one&quot; 
 evaluation. In August 1999, NIST narrowed the field to five &quot;round 
 two&quot; candidates:</P>

<P>Adding one or more AES ciphers to <A href="web.html#FreeSWAN">Linux

 available code exists to start from. One complication is that our code 
 is built for a 64-bit block cipher and AES uses a 128-bit block.

<DT><A name="authentication">Authentication</A></DT>
<DD>Ensuring that a message originated from the expected sender and has 
 not been altered on route. <A href="#IPSEC">IPSEC</A> uses 
 authentication in two places: </DD>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>peer authentication, authenticating the players in <A href="#IKE">
IKE</A>'s <A href="#DH">Diffie-Hellman</A> key  exchanges to prevent <A href="#middle">
man-in-the-middle  attacks</A>. This can be done in a number of ways. 
The methods  supported by FreeS/WAN are discussed in our <A href="config.html#choose">
configuration</A> document.</LI>
<LI>packet authentication, authenticating packets on an established <A href="#SA">
 SA</A>, either with a separate <A href="#AH">authentication header</A>
 or with the optional  authentication in the <A href="#ESP">ESP</A>
 protocol. In either  case, packet authentication uses a <A href="#HMAC">
hashed message  athentication code</A> technique.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Outside IPSEC, passwords are perhaps the most common authentication 
 mechanism. Their function is essentially to authenticate the person's 
 identity to the system. Passwords are generally only as secure as the 
 network they travel over. If you send a cleartext password over a 
 tapped phone line or over a network with a packet sniffer on it, the 
 security provided by that password becomes zero. Sending an encrypted 
 password is no better; the attacker merely records it and reuses it at 
 his convenience. This is called a <A href="#replay">replay</A> attack.</P>
<P>A common solution to this problem is a <A href="#challenge">
challenge-response</A> system. This defeats simple  eavesdropping and 
replay attacks. Of course an attacker might still  try to break the 
cryptographic algorithm used, or the <A href="#random"> random number</A>
 generator.</P>
<DT><A name="auto">Automatic keying</A></DT>
<DD>A mode in which keys are automatically generated at connection 
 establisment and new keys automaically created periodically 
 thereafter. Contrast with <A href="ipsec.html#manual">manual keying</A>
 in which  a single stored key is used. </DD>
<P>IPSEC uses the <A href="#DH">Diffie-Hellman key exchange  protocol</A>
 to create keys. An <A href="authentication">authentication</A>
 mechansim is required for  this. The methods supported by FreeS/WAN 
are discussed in our <A href="config.html#choose">configuration</A>
 document.</P>
<P>Having an attacker break the authentication is emphatically not a 
 good idea. An attacker that breaks authentication, and manages to 
 subvert some other network entities (DNS, routers or gateways), can 
 use a <A href="#middle">man-in-the middle attack</A> to break the 
 security of your IPSEC connections.</P>
<P>However, having an attacker break the authentication in automatic 
 keying is not quite as bad as losing the key in manual keying.</P>
<UL>
<LI>An attacker who reads /etc/ipsec.conf and gets the keys for a 
 manually keyed connection can, without further effort, read all 
 messages encrypted with those keys, including any old messages he  may 
have archived.</LI>
<LI>Automatic keying has a property called <A href="#PFS">perfect 
 forward secrecy</A>. An attacker who breaks the authentication  gets 
none of the automatically generated keys and cannot  immediately read 
any messages. He has to mount a successful <A href="#middle">
man-in-the-middle attack</A> in real time before he  can read anything. 
He cannot read old archived messages at all and  will not be able to 
read any future messages not caught by  man-in-the-middle tricks.</LI>
</UL>
<P>That said, the secrets used for authentication, stored in <A href="manpage.d/ipsec.secrets.5.html">
ipsec.secrets(5)</A>, should  still be protected as tightly as 
cryptographic keys.</P>

<DD>Our default block cipher, <A href="#3DES">triple DES</A>, is slower 
 than many alternate ciphers that might be used. Speeds achieved, 
 however, seem adequate for many purposes. For example, the assembler

</UL>
<DT><A name="paradox">Birthday paradox</A></DT>
<DD>Not really a paradox, just a rather counter-intuitive mathematical 
 fact. In a group of 23 people, the chance of a least one pair having 
 the same birthday is over 50%. </DD>
<P>The second person has 1 chance in 365 (ignoring leap years) of 
 matching the first. If they don't match, the third person's chances of 
 matching one of them are 2/365. The 4th, 3/365, and so on. The total 
 of these chances grows more quickly than one might guess.</P>
<DT><A name="block">Block cipher</A></DT>
<DD>A <A href="#symmetric">symmetric cipher</A> which operates on 
 fixed-size blocks of plaintext, giving a block of ciphertext for each. 
 Contrast with <A href="#stream"> stream cipher</A>. Block ciphers can 
 be used in various <A href="#mode">modes</A> when multiple block are 
 to be encrypted. </DD>
<P><A href="#DES">DES</A> is among the the best known and widely used 
 block ciphers, but is now obsolete. Its 56-bit key size makes it <A href="politics.html#desnotsecure">
highly insecure</A> today. <A href="#3DES">Triple  DES</A> is the 
default transform for <A href="web.html#FreeSWAN">Linux  FreeS/WAN</A>
 because it is the only cipher which is both required in  the <A href="rfc.html#RFC">
RFCs</A> and apparently secure.</P>
<P>The current generation of block ciphers -- such as <A href="#Blowfish">
Blowfish</A>, <A href="#CAST128">CAST-128</A> and <A href="#IDEA">IDEA</A>
 -- all use 64-bit blocks and 128-bit keys. The  next generation, <A href="#AES">
AES</A>, uses 128-bit blocks and  supports key sizes up to 256 bits.</P>
<P>The <A href="http://www.ii.uib.no/~larsr/bc.html"> Block Cipher 
 Lounge</A> web site has more information.</P>
<DT><A name="Blowfish">Blowfish</A></DT>
<DD>A <A href="#block">block cipher</A> using 64-bit blocks and keys of 
 up to 448 bits, designed by <A href="biblio.html#schneier">Bruce 
Schneier</A> and  used in several products. </DD>
<P>This is not required by the <A href="#IPSEC">IPSEC</A> RFCs and not 
 currently used in <A href="web.html#FreeSWAN">Linux FreeS/WAN</A>.</P>
<DT><A name="brute">Brute force attack (exhaustive search)</A></DT>
<DD>Breaking a cipher by trying all possible keys. This is always 
 possible in theory (except against a <A href="#OTP">one-time pad</A>), 
 but it becomes practical only if the key size is inadequate. For an 
 important example, see our document on the <A href="politics.html#desnotsecure">
insecurity of DES</A> with its 56-bit key. For an  analysis of key 
sizes required to resist plausible brute force  attacks, see <A href="http://www.counterpane.com/keylength.html">
this  paper</A>. </DD>
<P>Longer keys protect against brute force attacks. Each extra bit in 
 the key doubles the number of possible keys and therefore doubles the 
 work a brute force attack must do. A large enough key defeats <STRONG>
 any</STRONG> brute force attack.</P>
<P>For example, the EFF's <A href="#EFF">DES Cracker</A> searches a 
 56-bit key space in an average of a few days. Let us assume an 
 attacker that can find a 64-bit key (256 times harder) by brute force 
 search in a second (a few hundred thousand times faster). For a 96-bit 
 key, that attacker needs 2<SUP>32</SUP> seconds, just over a century. 
 Against a 128-bit key, he needs 2<SUP>32</SUP> centuries or about 
 400,000,000,000 years. Your data is then obviously secure against 
 brute force attacks. Even if our estimate of the attacker's speed is 
 off by a factor of a million, it still takes him 400,000 years to 
 crack a message.</P>
<P>This is why</P>

 bits</LI>
<LI>any cipher we add to Linux FreeS/WAN will have <EM>at least</EM> a 
128-bit key</LI>
</UL>
<P><STRONG>Cautions:</STRONG>
<BR><EM> Inadequate keylength always indicates a weak cipher</EM> but 
it is  important to note that <EM>adequate keylength does not 
necessarily  indicate a strong cipher</EM>. There are many attacks 
other than brute  force, and adequate keylength <EM>only</EM>
 guarantees resistance to  brute force. Any cipher, whatever its key 
size, will be weak if design  or implementation flaws allow other 
attacks.</P>
<P>Also, <EM>once you have adequate keylength</EM> (somewhere around 
 90 or 100 bits), <EM>adding more key bits make no practical  difference</EM>
, even against brute force. Consider our 128-bit  example above that 
takes 400 billion years to break by brute force. Do  we care if an 
extra 16 bits of key put that into the quadrillions? No.  What about 16 
fewer bits reducing it to the 112-bit security level of <A href="#3DES">
 Triple DES</A>, which our example attacker could break  in just over a 
billion years? No again, unless we're being really  paranoid about 
safety margins.</P>
<P>There may be reasons of convenience in the design of the cipher to 
 support larger keys. For example <A href="#Blowfish">Blowfish</A>
 allows up to 448 bits and <A href="#RC4">RC4</A> up to 2048, but 
 beyond 100-odd bits it makes no difference to practical security.</P>

<P>This is more secure than passwords against two simple attacks:</P>
<UL>
<LI>If cleartext passwords are sent across the wire (e.g. for  telnet), 
an eavesdropper can grab them. The attacker may even be  able to break 
into other systems if the user has chosen the same  password for them.</LI>
<LI>If an encrypted password is sent, an attacker can record the 
 encrypted form and use it later. This is called a replay  attack.</LI>
</UL>
<P>A challenge-response system never sends a password, either 
 cleartext or encrypted.  An attacker cannot record the response to one 
 challenge and use it as a response to a later challenge. The random 
 number is different each time.</P>

 algorithm used, or the <A href="#random">random number</A> generator.</P>

<DT><A name="DOS">Denial of service (DoS) attack</A></DT>
<DD>An attack that aims at denying some service to legitimate users of 
a  system, rather than providing a service to the attacker. 
<UL>
<LI>One variant is a flooding attack, overwhelming the system with  too 
many packets, to much email, or whatever.</LI>
<LI>A closely related variant is a resource exhaustion attack. For 
 example, consider a &quot;TCP SYN flood&quot; attack. Setting up a TCP 
 connection involves a three-packet exchange: 
<UL>
<LI>Initiator: Connection please (SYN)</LI>
<LI>Responder: OK (ACK)</LI>
<LI>Initiator: OK here too</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<P>If the attacker puts bogus source information in the first  packet, 
such that the second is never delivered, the responder may  wait a long 
time for the third to come back. If responder has  already allocated 
memory for the connection data structures, and  if many of these bogus 
packets arrive, the responder may run out  of memory.</P>
<LI>Another variant is to feed the system undigestible data, hoping  to 
make it sick. For example, IP packets are limited in size to  64K bytes 
and a fragment carries information on where it starts  within that 64K 
and how long it is. The &quot;ping of death&quot; delivers  fragments that say, 
for example, that they start at 60K and are  20K long. Attempting to 
re-assemble these without checking for  overflow can be fatal.</LI>

 first discovered, capable of crashing or disabling many operating 
 systems. They were also well-publicised, and today far fewer systems

<DT><A name="dlog">discrete logarithm problem</A></DT>
<DD>The problem of finding logarithms in a finite field. Given a field 
 defintion (such definitions always include some operation analogous to 
 multiplication) and two numbers, a base and a target, find the power 
 which the base must be raised to in order to yield the target. </DD>
<P>The discrete log problem is the basis of several cryptographic 
 systems, including the <A href="#DH">Diffie-Hellman</A> key exchange 
 used in the <A href="#IKE">IKE</A> protocol. The useful property is 
 that exponentiation is relatively easy but the inverse operation, 
 finding the logarithm, is hard. The cryptosystems are designed so that 
 the user does only easy operations (exponentiation in the field) but 
 an attacker must solve the hard problem (discrete log) to crack the 
 system.</P>
<P>There are several variants of the problem for different types of 
 field. The IKE/Oakley key determination protocol uses two variants, 
 either over a field modulo a prime or over a field defined by an 
 elliptic curve. We give an example modulo a prime below. For the 
 elliptic curve version, consult an advanced text such as <A href="biblio.html#handbook">
Handbook of Applied Cryptography</A>.</P>
<P>Given a prime <VAR>p</VAR>, a generator <VAR>g</VAR> for the field 
 modulo that prime, and a number <VAR>x</VAR> in the field, the problem 
 is to find <VAR>y</VAR> such that <VAR>g^y = x</VAR>.</P>
<P>For example, let p = 13. The field is then the integers from 0 to 
 12. Any integer equals one of these modulo 13. That is, the remainder 
 when any integer is divided by 13 must be one of these.</P>
<P>2 is a generator for this field.  That is, the powers of two modulo 
 13 run through all the non-zero numbers in the field. Modulo 13 we 
 have:</P>
<PRE>          y      x
        2^0  ==  1
        2^1  ==  2
        2^2  ==  4
        2^3  ==  8
        2^4  ==  3 that is, the remainder from 16/13 is 3
        2^5  ==  6          the remainder from 32/13 is 6
        2^6  == 12 and so on
        2^7  == 11
        2^8  ==  9
        2^9  ==  5
        2^10 == 10
        2^11 ==  7
        2^12 ==  1</PRE>
<P> Exponentiation in such a field is not difficult. Given, say, <NOBR><VAR>
y = 11</VAR>,</NOBR> calculating <NOBR><VAR>x = 7</VAR></NOBR> is 
straightforward. One method is just to calculate <NOBR><VAR>2^11 = 2048</VAR>
,</NOBR> then <NOBR><VAR>2048 mod 13 == 7</VAR>.</NOBR> When the field 
is modulo a large prime (say a few 100 digits) you need a silghtly 
cleverer method and even that is moderately expensive in computer time, 
but the calculation is still not  problematic in any basic way.</P>
<P> The discrete log problem is the reverse. In our example, given <NOBR>
<VAR>x = 7</VAR>,</NOBR> find the logarithm <NOBR><VAR>y = 11</VAR>.</NOBR>
 When the  field is modulo a large prime (or is based on a suitable 
elliptic  curve), this is indeed problematic. No solution method that 
is not  catastrophically expensive is known. Quite a few mathematicians 
have  tackled this problem. No efficient method has been found and 
mathematicians  do not expect that one will be. It seems likely no 
efficient solution  to either of the main variants the discrete log 
problem exists.</P>
<P>Note, however, that no-one has proven such methods do not exist. If 
 a solution to either variant were found, the security of any crypto 
 system using that variant would be destroyed.  This is one reason <A href="#IKE">
 IKE</A> supports two variants. If one is broken, we can  switch to the 
other.</P>

<DD>An <A href="#active">active attack</A> in which the attacker 
 impersonates each of the legitimate players in a protocol to the 
 other. </DD>
<P>For example, if <A href="#alicebob">Alice and Bob</A> are 
 negotiating a key via the <A href="#DH">Diffie-Hellman</A> key 
 agreement, and are not using <A href="#authentication">authentication</A>
 to be certain they are  talking to each other, then an attacker able 
to insert himself in the  communication path can deceive both players.</P>
<P>Call the attacker Mallory. For Bob, he pretends to be Alice. For 
 Alice, he pretends to be Bob. Two keys are then negotiated, 
 Alice-to-Mallory and Bob-to-Mallory. Alice and Bob each think the key 
 they have is Alice-to-Bob.</P>
<P>A message from Alice to Bob then goes to Mallory who decrypts it, 
 reads it and/or saves a copy, re-encrypts using the Bob-to-Mallory key 
 and sends it along to Bob. Bob decrypts successfully and sends a reply 
 which Mallory decrypts, reads, re-encrypts and forwards to Alice.</P>
<P>To make this attack effective, Mallory must</P>
<UL>
<LI>subvert some part of the network in some way that lets him carry 
 out the deception
<BR> possible targets: DNS, router, Alice or Bob's machine, mail 
 server, ...</LI>
<LI>beat any authentication mechanism Alice and Bob use
<BR> strong authentication defeats the attack entirely; this is why <A href="#IKE">

<BR> not hard if Alice and Bob are using email; quite difficult in some

<DT><A name="meet">Meet-in-the-middle attack</A></DT>
<DD>A divide-and-conquer attack which breaks a cipher into two parts, 
 works against each separately, and compares results. Probably the best 
 known example is an attack on double DES. This applies in principle to 
 any pair of block ciphers, e.g. to an encryption system using, say, 
 CAST-128 and Blowfish, but we will describe it for double DES. </DD>
<P>Double DES encryption and decryption can be written:</P>
<PRE>        C = E(k2,E(k1,P))
        P = D(k1,D(k2,C))</PRE>
<P>Where C is ciphertext, P is plaintext, E is encryption, D is 
 decryption, k1 is one key, and k2 is the other key. If we know a P, C 
 pair, we can try and find the keys with a brute force attack, trying 
 all possible k1, k2 pairs. Since each key is 56 bits, there are  2<SUP>
112</SUP> such pairs and this attack is painfully  inefficient.</P>
<P>The meet-in-the middle attack re-writes the equations to calculate 
 a middle value M:</P>
<PRE>        M = E(k1,P)
        M = D(k2,C)</PRE>
<P>Now we can try some large number of D(k2,C) decryptions with 
 various values of k2 and store the results in a table. Then start 
 doing E(k1,P) encryptions, checking each result to see if it is in the 
 table.</P>
<P>With enough table space, this breaks double DES with 2<SUP>57</SUP>
 work. The memory requirements of such attacks can be prohibitive, but 
 there is a whole body of research literature on methods of reducing 
 them.</P>
<DT><A name="digest">Message Digest Algorithm</A></DT>
<DD>An algorithm which takes a message as input and produces a hash or

<DD><STRONG>M</STRONG>aximum <STRONG>T</STRONG>ransmission <STRONG> U</STRONG>
nit, the largest size of packet that can be sent  over a link. This is 
determined by the underlying network, but must be  taken account of at 
the IP level. </DD>
<P>IP packets, which can be up to 64K bytes each, must be packaged 
 into lower-level packets of the appropriate size for the underlying 
 network(s) and re-assembled on the other end. When a packet must pass 
 over multiple networks, each with its own MTU, and many of the MTUs 
 are unknown to the sender, this becomes a fairly complex problem. See <A
href="#pathMTU"> path MTU discovery</A> for details.</P>
<P>Often the MTU is a few hundred bytes on serial links and 1500  on 
Ethernet. There are, however, serial link protocols which use a  larger 
MTU to avoid fragmentation at the ethernet/serial  boundary, and newer 
(especially gigabit) Ethernet networks sometimes  support much larger 
packets because these are more efficient in some  applications.</P>

 knows the message length. No such proof exists for any other  cipher.</P>
<P>There are, however, several problems with this &quot;perfect&quot;  cipher.</P>
<UL>
<LI>It is wildly impractical for many applications. Key management  is 
difficult or impossible.</LI>
<LI>It is <EM>extremely</EM> fragile. Small changes which violate  the 
conditions listed above do not just weaken the cipher a bit;  quite 
often they destroy its security completely. 
<UL>
<LI>Re-using the pad weakens it to the point where it can be  broken 
with pencil and paper. With a computer, the attack is  trivially easy.</LI>
<LI>Using computer-generated pseudo-random numbers instead of a  really <A
href="#random">random</A> pad completely invalidates  the security 
proof. Depending on random number generator used,  this may also give 
an extremely weak cipher.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>If an attacker knows the plaintext and has an intercepted  message, 
he can discover the pad. This does not matter if the  attacker is just 
a <A href="#passive">passive</A> eavesdropper. It  gives him no 
plaintext he didn't already know and we don't care  that he learns a 
pad which we'll never re-use. However, knowing  the pad lets an <A href="#active">

 on a path can handle without fragmentation -- that is, without any

<P>This is done as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>originator sends the largest packets allowed by <A href="#MTU">MTU</A>
 of the first link, setting the DF  (<STRONG>d</STRONG>on't <STRONG>f</STRONG>

<LI>eventually, you settle on a size that can pass all routers</LI>
<LI>thereafter, originator just sends that size and no-one has to 
 fragment</LI>
</UL>
<P>Since this requires co-operation of many systems, and since the

<UL>
<LI>malformed ICMP messages</LI>
<LI>hosts that ignore or mishandle these ICMP messages</LI>

 method, named for its three inventors. The algorithm is widely used

 encumbrances in September 2000. </DD>
<P> For a full explanation of the algorithm, consult one of the 
standard references such as <A href="biblio.html#schneier">Applied 
Cryptography</A>. A simple explanation is: </P>
<P> The great 17th century French mathematician <A href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Fermat.html">
Fermat</A> proved that, for any prime p and number x, 0 
<!--= x < p:
<pre-->
 x^p == x 
 modulo p  x^(p-1) == 1  modulo p, non-zero x  From this it follows 
that if we have a pair of primes p, q and two numbers e, d such that: </P>
<PRE>
	ed == 1			modulo lcm( p-1, q-1)
</PRE>
 where lcm() is least common multiple, then for all x, 0 
<!--= x < pq:
<pre-->
 x^(ed-1) == 1 
 modulo pq, non-zero x  x^ed == x  modulo pq  So we construct such as 
set of numbers p, q, e, d and publish the product N=pq and e as the 
public key. Encryption is then: 
<PRE>
	c = x^e			modulo N
</PRE>
 An attacker cannot deduce x from the cyphertext c, short of either 
factoring N or solving the <A href="#dlog">discrete logarithm</A>
 problem for this field. If p, q are large primes (hundreds or 
thousands of bits) no efficient solution to either problem is known. 
<P> The receiver, knowing the private key (N and d), can readily find x 
sixce: </P>
<PRE>
	c^d == (x^e)^d		modulo N
	    == x^ed		modulo N
	    == x		modulo N
</PRE>
 This gives an effective public key technique, with only a couple of 
problems. It uses a good deal of computer time, since calculations with 
large integers are not cheap, and there is no proof it is necessarily 
secure since no-one has proven either factoring or discrete log cannot 
be done efficiently.

<DT><A name="subnet">subnet</A></DT>
<DD>A group of IP addresses which are logically one network, typically

 The range of addresses in a subnet is described using a subnet mask. 
 See next entry.</DD>
<DT>subnet mask</DT>
<DD>A method of indicating the addresses included in a subnet. Here are 
 two equivalent examples:
<UL>
<LI>101.101.101.0/24</LI>
<LI>101.101.101.0 with mask 255.255.255.0</LI>
</UL>
</DD>
<P>The '24' is shorthand for a mask with the top 24 bits one and the 
 rest zero. This is exactly the same as 255.255.255.0 which has three 
 all-ones bytes and one all-zeros byte.</P>
<P>These indicate that, for this range of addresses, the top 24 bits 
 are to be treated as naming a network (often referred to as &quot;the 
 101.101.101.0/24 subnet&quot;) while most combinations of the low 8 bits 
 can be used to designate machines on that network. Two addresses are 
 reserved; 101.101.101.0 refers to the subnet rather than a specific 
 machine while 101.101.101.255 is a broadcast address. 1 to 254 are 
 available for machines.</P>
<P>It is common to find subnets arranged in a hierarchy. For example, 
 a large company might have a /16 subnet and allocate /24 subnets 
 within that to departments. An ISP might have a large subnet and 
 allocate /26 subnets (64 addresses, 62 usable) to business customers 
 and /29 subnets (8 addresses, 6 usable) to residential clients.</P>

<DT><A name="symmetric">Symmetric cryptography</A></DT>
<DD>Symmetric cryptography, also referred to as conventional or secret 
 key cryptography, relies on a <EM>shared secret key</EM>, identical 
 for sender and receiver. Sender encrypts with that key, receiver 
 decrypts with it. The idea is that an eavesdropper without the key be 
 unable to read the messages. There are two main types of symmetric 
 cipher, <A href="#block">block ciphers</A> and <A href="#stream">
stream ciphers</A>. </DD>
<P>Symmetric cryptography contrasts with <A href="#public">public  key</A>
 or asymmetric systems where the two players use different  keys.</P>
<P>The great difficulty in symmetric cryptography is, of course, key 
 management. Sender and receiver <EM>must</EM> have identical keys and 
 those keys <EM>must</EM> be kept secret from everyone else. Not too 
 much of a problem if only two people are involved and they can 
 conveniently meet privately or employ a trusted courier. Quite a 
 problem, though, in other circumstances.</P>
<P>It gets much worse if there are many people. An application might 
 be written to use only one key for communication among 100 people, for 
 example, but there would be serious problems. Do you actually trust 
 all of them that much? Do they trust each other that much? Should 
 they? What is at risk if that key is compromised? How are you  going 
 to distribute that key to everyone without risking its secrecy? What 
 do you do when one of them leaves the company? Will you even know?</P>
<P>On the other hand, if you need unique keys for every possible 
 connection between a group of 100, then each user must have 99 keys. 
 You need either 99*100/2 = 4950 <EM>secure</EM> key exchanges between 
 users or a central authority that <EM>securely</EM> distributes 100 
 key packets, each with a different set of 99 keys.</P>
<P>Either of these is possible, though tricky, for 100 users. Either 
 becomes an administrative nightmare for larger numbers. Moreover, keys <EM>
 must</EM> be changed regularly, so the problem of key distribution 
 comes up again and again. If you use the same key for many messages 
 then an attacker has more text to work with in an attempt to crack 
 that key. Moreover, one successful crack will give him or her the text 
 of all those messages.</P>
<P>In short, the <EM>hardest part of conventional cryptography is key 
 management</EM>. Today the standard solution is to build a <A href="#hybrid">
hybrid system</A> using <A href="#public">public  key</A> techniques to 
manage keys.</P>

<P><A href="#IPSEC">IPSEC</A> is not the only technique available for 
 building VPNs, but it is the only method defined by <A href="rfc.html#RFC">
RFCs</A> and supported by many vendors. VPNs are by no  means the only 
thing you can do with IPSEC, but they may be the most  important 
application for many users.</P>
