.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Newhostkey
outputs (into
.IR filename ,
which can be `\fB-\fR' for standard output)
an RSA private key suitable for this host,
in
.IR /etc/ipsec.secrets
format
(see
.IR ipsec.secrets (5)).
Normally,
.I newhostkey
invokes
.IR rsasigkey
(see
.IR ipsec_rsasigkey (8))
with the
.B \-\-verbose
option, so a narrative of what is being done appears on standard error.
.PP
The
.B \-\-output
specifier, although it is syntactically an option and can appear at
any point among the options (it doesn't have to be first),
is not optional.
The specified
.I filename
is created under umask
.B 077
if nonexistent;
if it already exists and is non-empty,
a warning message about that is sent to standard error,
and the output is appended to the file.
.PP
The
.B \-\-quiet
option suppresses both the
.IR rsasigkey
narrative and the existing-file warning message.
.PP
The
.B \-\-bits
option specifies the number of bits in the key;
the current default is 2192 and we do not recommend use of anything
shorter unless unusual constraints demand it.
.PP
The
.B \-\-hostname
option is passed through to
.IR rsasigkey
to tell it what host name to label the output with
(via its
.B \-\-hostname
option).
.PP
The output format is that of
.IR rsasigkey ,
with bracketing added to complete the
.I ipsec.secrets
format.
In the usual case, where
.I ipsec.secrets
contains only the host's own private key,
the output of
.I newhostkey
is sufficient as a complete
.I ipsec.secrets
file.

.SH BUGS
As with
.IR rsasigkey ,
the run time is difficult to predict,
since depletion of the system's randomness pool can cause
arbitrarily long waits for random bits,
and the prime-number searches can also take unpredictable
(and potentially large) amounts of CPU time.
See
.IR ipsec_rsasigkey (8)
for some typical performance numbers.
.PP
A higher-level tool which could handle the clerical details
of changing to a new key would be helpful.
.PP
The requirement for
.B \-\-output
is a blemish,
but private keys are extremely sensitive information
and unusual precautions seem justified.
