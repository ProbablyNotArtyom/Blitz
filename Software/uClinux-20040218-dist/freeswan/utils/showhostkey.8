.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Showhostkey
outputs (on standard output) a public key suitable for this host,
using the host key information stored in
.IR /etc/ipsec.secrets .
In general only the super-user can run this command,
since only he can read
.IR ipsec.secrets .
.PP
By default, the output format is the text form of a DNS KEY record;
the host name is the one included in the key information
(or, if that is not available,
the output of
.BR "hostname\ \-\-fqdn" ),
with a
.B \&.
appended.
If information about how the key was generated is available,
that is provided as a DNS-file comment.
For example (with the key data trimmed down for clarity):
.PP
.nf
  ; RSA 2048 bits   xy.example.com   Sat Apr 15 13:53:22 2000
  xy.example.com.   IN   KEY   0x4200 4 1 AQOF8tZ2...+buFuFn/
.fi
.PP
The
.B \-\-txt
option causes the output to be in opportunistic-encryption DNS TXT record
format,
with the specified
.I gateway
value.
Again, generation information is included if available.
For example,
.B "\-\-txt 10.11.12.13"
might give (with the key data trimmed for clarity):
.PP
.nf
  ; RSA 2048 bits   xy.example.com   Sat Apr 15 13:53:22 2000
      IN TXT  "X-IPsec-Server(10)=10.11.12.13 AQOF8tZ2...+buFuFn/"
.fi
.PP
No name is supplied in the TXT record
because there are too many possibilities,
depending on how it will be used.
If the text string is longer than 255 bytes,
it is split up into multiple strings (matching the restrictions of
the DNS TXT binary format) in a way that is compatible with
BIND 8's automatic splitter.
.PP
The
.B \-\-left
and
.B \-\-right
options cause the output to be in
.IR ipsec.conf (5)
format, as a
.B leftrsasigkey
or
.B rightrsasigkey
parameter respectively.
Again, generation information is included if available.
For example,
.B \-\-left
might give (with the key data trimmed down for clarity):
.PP
.nf
  # RSA 2048 bits   xy.example.com   Sat Apr 15 13:53:22 2000
  leftrsasigkey=0sAQOF8tZ2...+buFuFn/
.fi
.PP
Normally, the default key for this host
(the one with no host identities specified for it) is the one extracted.
The
.B \-\-id
option overrides this,
causing extraction of the key labeled with the specified
.IR identity ,
if any.
The specified
.I identity
must
.I exactly
match the identity in the file;
in particular, the comparison is case-sensitive.
.PP
The
.B \-\-file
option overrides the default for where the key information should be
found, and takes it from the specified
.IR secretfile .
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
A complaint about ``no IN KEY line found'' indicates that the
host has a key but it was generated with an old version of FreeS/WAN
and does not contain the information that
.I showhostkey
needs.

.SH BUGS
Arguably,
rather than just reporting the no-IN-KEY-line-found problem,
.I showhostkey
should be smart enough to run the existing key through
.I rsasigkey
with the
.B \-\-oldkey
option, to generate a suitable output line.
.PP
The need to specify the gateway address (etc.) for
.B \-\-txt
is annoying, but there is no good way to determine it automatically.
.PP
There should be a way to specify the priority value for TXT records;
currently it is hardwired to
.BR 10 .
.PP
The
.B \-\-id
option assumes that the
.I identity
appears on the same line as the
.B ":\ RSA\ {"
that begins the key proper.
