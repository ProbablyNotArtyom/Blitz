.SH NAME
ipsec setup \- control IPsec subsystem
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ipsec
.B setup
command
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Setup
controls the FreeS/WAN IPsec subsystem,
including both the Klips kernel code and the Pluto key-negotiation daemon.
(It is a synonym for the ``rc'' script for the subsystem;
the system runs the equivalent of
.B "ipsec setup start"
at boot time,
and
.B "ipsec setup stop"
at shutdown time, more or less.)
.PP
The action taken depends on the specific
.IR command ,
and on the contents of the
.B config
.B setup
section of the
IPsec configuration file (\c
.IR /etc/ipsec.conf ,
see
.IR ipsec.conf (5)).
Current
.IR command s
are:
.TP 10
.B start
start Klips and Pluto,
including setting up Klips to do crypto operations on the 
interface(s) specified in the configuration file,
and (if the configuration file so specifies)
setting up manually-keyed connections and/or
asking Pluto to negotiate automatically-keyed connections
to other security gateways
.TP
.B stop
shut down Klips and Pluto,
including tearing down all existing crypto connections
.TP
.B restart
equivalent to
.B stop
followed by
.B start
.TP
.B status
report the status of the subsystem;
normally just reports
.B "IPsec running"
and
.BR "pluto pid \fInnn\fP" ,
or
.BR "IPsec stopped" ,
and exits with status 0,
but will go into more detail (and exit with status 1)
if something strange is found.
(An ``illicit'' Pluto is one that does not match the process ID in
Pluto's lock file;
an ``orphaned'' Pluto is one with no lock file.)
.PP
The
.B stop
operation tries to clean up properly even if assorted accidents
have occurred,
e.g. Pluto having died without removing its lock file.
If
.B stop
discovers that the subsystem is (supposedly) not running,
it will complain,
but will do its cleanup anyway before exiting with status 1.
.PP
Although a number of configuration-file parameters influence
.IR setup 's
operations, the key one is the
.B interfaces
parameter, which must be right or chaos will ensue.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
All output from the commands
.B start
and
.B stop
goes both to standard
output and to
.IR syslogd (8),
via
.IR logger (1).
Selected additional information is logged only to
.IR syslogd (8).

.SH BUGS
Old versions of
.IR logger (1)
inject spurious extra newlines onto standard output.
