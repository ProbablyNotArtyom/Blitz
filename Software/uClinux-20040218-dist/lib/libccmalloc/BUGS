BUGS:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Linking and compiling your own projects with Sun's CC still does not
work.

(2) On newer Linux systems or just with newer version of GLIBC I sometimes
get a call from 'free()' after the shutdown code of ccmalloc has been
executed.  This is currently reported as a problem but should be ignored.

(3) If you call malloc and free only implicitly over library functions
of the C-library like strdup then the linker does not link the malloc
called by strdup to the malloc supported by ccmalloc and you do not
get any ccmalloc report at all! To avoid this make sure that your object
file has malloc or free as external symbols (e.g. the leak in the program
`main(){strdup();}' can not be detected)

(4) Some standard libraries like libc or lg++ may also have memory leaks.
ccmalloc tries to exclude these leaks from the report (see `library-leaks'
in `start-up-file' or `.ccmalloc').  However some libraries maintain an
internal buffer usually referenced through a static variable and the buffer
memory is never released.  These buffers are always reported as a leak and
in my opinion actually should be reported as a leak, since using a static
pointer to a buffer which is never released is poor design in my view.
