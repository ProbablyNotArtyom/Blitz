Making and Installing the OpenLDAP Distribution
===============================================

This file provides brief instructions on how to build and install
OpenLDAP on UNIX (and UNIX-like) system.  More detailed information
and instructions can be found in The OpenLDAP Administrator's Guide
(available from http://www.openldap.org/doc/).

It is recommended that you read, or at least skim through, ALL of the
instructions in this file before attempting to build the software.

It is also recommended you review the Frequently Asked Questions
(http://www.openldap.org/faq/) pages, in particular the Installation
section (http://www.openldap.org/faq/index.cgi?file=8) and Platform
Hints (http://www.openldap.org/faq/index.cgi?file=9) should be
examined.

Making and Installing the OpenLDAP Distribution
-----------------------------------------------

1.   Unpack the distribution and change directory:

        % tar xfz openldap-VERSION.tgz
        % cd openldap-VERSION

     (replacing VERSION with the appropriate version string).  If you
     are reading this file, you probably have already done this!

2.   Type:

        % ./configure --help

     to list available configuration options.

     The configure script uses environmental variables for determining
     compiler/linker options including:

        Variable        Description     Example
        CC              C compiler      gcc
        CFLAGS          C flags         -O -g
        CPPFLAGS        cpp flags       -I/path/include -DFOO=42
        LDFLAGS         ld flags        -L/usr/local/lib
        LIBS            libraries       -llib
        PATH            command path    /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin

3.   Configure the build system

        % [env settings] ./configure [options]

     If all goes well, the configure script with automatically detect
     the appropriate settings.  However, you may need to specify
     options and/or environment variables to obtain desired results.

4.   Build dependencies

        % make depend

5.   Build the system

        % make

     If all goes well, the system will build as configured.  If not,
     return to step 3 after reviewing the configuration settings.  You
     may want to consult the Platform Hints subsection of the FAQ if
     you have not done so already.

6.   Test the standalone system

     This step requires the standalone LDAP server, slapd(8), with
     BDB and/or LDBM support.

        % make test

     If all goes well, the system has been built as configured.  If
     not, return to step 4 after reviewing your configuration
     settings.  You may want to consult the Installation section of
     the FAQ if you have not done so already.

7.   install the binaries and man pages.  You may need to be come the
     super-user (e.g. root) to do this (depending on where you are
     installing things):

        % su root -c 'make install'

8.   That's it!

See the OpenLDAP Administrator's Guide and the manual pages for the
individual applications for configuration and use information. You may
also want to edit the configuration files used by the various
components.  These configuration files are located in the OpenLDAP
configuration directory (normally /usr/local/etc/openldap).

        ldap.conf               client defaults
        slapd.conf              Standalone LDAP daemon
        schema/*.schema         Schema Definitions
