 - some recently discovered message sequences crash ilmid
 - ENI driver: closing an AAL0 socket while data is arriving at a high rate

   Replies it sends even if the extension is missing from the incoming Request
 - ANS: libresolve conflicts with libc on some systems
 - ENI driver loses synchronization on some systems, leading to panics or hung
   VCs (these may be two distinct problems)
 - few if any drivers build properly as modules
 - swc show  only displays manually configured VCs
