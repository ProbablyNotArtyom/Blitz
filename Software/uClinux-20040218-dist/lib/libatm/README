--------------------------------------

This is experimental software. There are known bugs and certainly even
many more yet unknown problems. Internal and external interfaces may
still change every once in a while. Use at your own risk.

Please see  http://linux-atm.sourceforge.net/  for a list of
features supported by ATM on Linux.

If you're just looking for the device drivers: you may find what you're looking
for under src/extra/drivers.  Most are already in the mainstream kernel or, for
those which are not integrated, visit http://linux-atm.sourceforge.net/info.php

For usage and installation instructions, please read the "ATM on Linux HOWTO"
in the doc/ directory.  The README in that directory explains how to generate
alternative document types of the documentation.

For known restrictions and bugs, please read the file BUGS.
