Libpng 1.0.12 - June 8, 2001

This is a public release of libpng, intended for use in production codes.

Changes since the last public release (1.0.11):

  Test for Windows platform in pngconf.h when including malloc.h (Emmanuel Blot)
  Updated makefile.cygwin and handling of Cygwin's ALL_STATIC in pngconf.h
  Added some never-to-be-executed code in pnggccrd.c to quiet compiler warnings.
  Bumped DLLNUM to 2.
  Added a check for attempts to read or write PLTE in grayscale PNG datastreams.
  Eliminated the png_error about apps using png_read|write_init().  Instead,
    libpng will reallocate the png_struct and info_struct if they are too small.
    This achieves future binary compatibility for old applications written for
    libpng-0.88 and earlier.  Expanded the warnings about incompatible library
    and application.
  Modified png_create_struct so it passes user mem_ptr to user memory allocator.
  Check for missing profile length field in iCCP chunk and free the chunk_data
     in case of truncated iCCP chunk.
  Added netware project, distributed in a separate zip file.
  Began distributing wince project in a separate zip file.
  Updated contrib/gregbook
