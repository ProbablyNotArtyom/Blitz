uClinux TOOLS
-------------

No compiler tools are provided in the uClinux source distribution.
You need to either get a pre-built binary package from www.uclinux.org,
or compile yourself a cross tool chain.

You will need:

    GNU gcc      (currently we use 2.95.3)
    GNU binutils (currently we use 2.10)
    GNU gdb      (currently we use 5.0)
    elf2flt
