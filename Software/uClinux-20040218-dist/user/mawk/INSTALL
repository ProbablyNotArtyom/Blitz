Look at the file config.user and edit to set user defines.

if your system is one of
   apollo
   convex
   mips
   sgi
   ultrix-mips
   cray
   hpux  (read below)
   unixware (read below)

and you don't have gcc or prefer to use cc, then you may want to
copy config-user/your_system to config.user and edit that.

run

     configure 
     make


If you have problems, please report it.  If you can fix the problem, by
changing config.user, please send the results.  Else send output from
configure, make and config.h.  Send to brennan@whidbey.com.



DOS:
Look at the file msdos/INSTALL


HPUX:
Evidently there is more than one compiler and/or math library.  Some
configurations work out of the box (configure/make). Others need
CFLAGS='+O2 +FPZO'.  On HPUX 9.05 with the ansi compiler HP92453-01
A.09.77 set  CFLAGS='-Ae +O2 +FPZO'. Thanks to Dr. Rafael R.
Pappalardo<rafapa@mozart.us.es> for this info.



UNIXWARE:
On some but not all versions, configure might decide you don't have
memcpy.  Remove  #define NO_MEMCPY 1   from config.h.
If the fpe_test check fails, change the definition of  TURN_ON_FPE_TRAPS
to

#define  TURN_ON_FPE_TRAPS() fpsetmask(fpgetmask()|FP_X_DZ|FP_X_OFL|FP_X_INV)
