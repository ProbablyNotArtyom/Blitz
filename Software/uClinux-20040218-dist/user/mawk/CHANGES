1.3.1 -> 1.3.2 Sep 1996

1) Numeric but not integer indices caused core dump in new array scheme.
   Fixed bug and fired test division.

2) Added ferror() checks on writes.

3) Added some static storage specs to array.c to keep non-ansi 
   compilers happy.

1.3 -> 1.3.1 Sep 1996
Release to new ftp site ftp://ftp.whidbey.net.

1) Workaround for overflow exception in strtod, sunos5.5 solaris.

2) []...] and [^]...] put ] in a class (or not in a class) without
   having to use back-slash escape.

1.2.2 -> 1.3 Jul 1996
Extensive redesign of array data structures to support large arrays and
fast access to arrays created with split.  Many of the ideas in the
new design were inspired by reading "The Design and Implementation of
Dynamic Hashing Sets and Tables in Icon" by William Griswold and
Gregg Townsend, SPE 23,351-367.
 
1.2.1 -> 1.2.2  Jan 1996

1) Improved autoconfig, in particular, fpe tests.  This is far from
   perfect and never will be until C standardizes an interface to ieee754.

2) Removed automatic error message on open failure for getline.

3) Flush all output before system().  Previous behavior was to only
   flush std{out,err}.

4) Explicitly fclose() all output on exit to work around AIX4.1 bug. 

5) Fixed random number generator to work with longs larger than
   32bits.

6) Added a type Int which is int on real machines and long on dos machines.
   Believe that all implicit assumptions that int=32bits are now gone.
