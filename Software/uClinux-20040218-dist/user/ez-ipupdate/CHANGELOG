switched symantics so that you now must specify either an interface or an
address for daemon mode. cleanup all the update functions and the check_info
functions. fixed some bugs, fixed a MAJOR bug that I introduced in some time
after 2.9.1 that caused daemon mode to not update properly (and get a lot of
people banned, oops!). fixed the update code so that it is self throtlling
(should have done that from the get go, espesially since adding the not
updating properly in daemon mode bug).

a major overhaul, thus -> 3.0.0
