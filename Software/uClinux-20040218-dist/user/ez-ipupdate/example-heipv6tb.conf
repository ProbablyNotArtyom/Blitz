# please create this file and ensure that the user that ez-ipupdate is running
# as has write permissions to it then uncomment this line, if you don't your
# dyndns account will probably get banned. if you run ez-ipupdate as root (bad
# idea, use "run-as-user") then you can just uncomment this line.
#cache-file=/etc/ez-ipupdate.cache.eth1

# for the mean time we'll just use a cache file in the temp directory
cache-file=/tmp/ez-ipupdate.cache

# uncomment this once you have everything working how you want and you are
# ready to have ez-ipupdate running in the background all the time. to stop it
# you can use "killall -QUIT ez-ipupdate" under linux.
#daemon

# for more security use one of the following (run-as-euser is not secure):
#run-as-user=nobody
#run-as-euser=nobody
