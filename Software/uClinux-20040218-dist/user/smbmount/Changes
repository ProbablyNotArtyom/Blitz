  series.

smbfs-0.7 -> smbfs-0.8

  that you have to patch your kernel to enable this feature.
- Added my latest patches for the 2.0.x kernel series to the package.

smbfs-0.6 -> smbfs-0.7

- smbfs now successfully connects to pathworks. Probably this helps
  other older LAN Manager servers as well.
- Added a hint to http://www.kki.org/linux-lan to README
- Fixed util/Makefile for easier optimization handling. Thanks to Rik
  Faith <faith@cs.unc.edu> for this one
- Restructured the Makefile a bit. Now 'make install' works!

- smbmount asked twice for password.
- smbmount ignored -p. Thanks to mbresnahan1@mmm.com.

smbfs-0.4 -> smbfs-0.5

- Added some bounds-checking. These might have been security holes
  when smb(u)mount was setuid root. Thanks to David Holland
  <dholland@hcs.harvard.edu> for this one.
- moved README.automounter to README

ksmbfs-0.3 -> smbfs-0.4

  with Windows 95. Many thanks for the patch.

ksmbfs-0.1 -> ksmbfs-0.2:

- uid/gid can be given symbolically
- automatically reconnect to a broken connection
- use 1 for unknown inode number, because some programs are confused by a zero
  inode number. Thanks to Gordon Chaffee <chaffee@plateau.cs.Berkeley.EDU>.

  Andrew Tridgell <tridge@arvidsjaur.anu.edu.au>
