Hi there!

In this package you'll find the new-and-improved linux ethernet
bridging code. I (Lennert Buytenhek) rewrote the linux bridging code
because the old code was a big mess and nonextensible.

The new code is published at:
	http://bridge.sourceforge.net/



Advantages of the new code are:
- Support for multiple bridge port groups (i.e. multiple independent
  bridges in one machine).
- Each bridge is seen as a logical device, which allows you to do
  firewalling between port groups for example.
- Everything is dynamic; bridges are created dynamically using the
  userspace configuration tool, ports are 'enslaved' dynamically, etc.
- It is being actively maintained.
- It uses a hash table for MAC addresses, not an AVL tree.
- It's small (currently 4 pages of i386 code) and modular.
- The source isn't a mess.
- It works as a module.


If you have any comments, questions or suggestions, please send email to
the mailing list.



Have fun!
Lennert Buytenhek
