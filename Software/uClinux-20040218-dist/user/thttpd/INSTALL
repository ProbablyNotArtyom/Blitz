Configuring:

    Edit Makefile.in to change the configuration options if necessary.

    % ./configure

    Likewise edit config.h, if necessary.

    % make


To install:

    % make install

    Edit one of your system rc files to run thttpd at boot time.  Do NOT
    run it from inetd, that setup is inefficient so thttpd doesn't support it.


Solaris:

    If you're running Solaris and you want to use the security-enhancing
    chroot feature, then you must create the TCP device files in the chroot
    tree.  There is no way around this, Solaris needs these files to accept
    network connections.  You need /dev/tcp, which is a symbolic link like so:
	/dev/tcp -> ../devices/pseudo/clone@0:tcp
    And you also need the file it points to:
	crw-rw-rw-  bin  11, 42 May 24 21:32 /devices/pseudo/clone@0:tcp
