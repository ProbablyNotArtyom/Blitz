Subject: Problems With Float Version of J0

Dear Steve,

     I took your advice and added tests using absolute error to the
test suite for Bessel functions.  Using 20 supposed zeros for J0 from
the program that I wrote about previously, I evaluated both the ordinary
function and the extended function.  These tests show that functions j0()
and j0l() are performing quite well.

     The float version is another story.  I have appended to this letter
a printout of the test results on j0f().  These tests show that j0f() is
having problems at root numbers 4-8, 12-14 and 18-20.

     The date on my copy of j0f.c is 06-26-92.  That is probably the date
that I downloaded it from a now-unknown ftp site.

K.B.
