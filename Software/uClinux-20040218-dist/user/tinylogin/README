TinyLogin is a suite of tiny Unix utilities for handling logging into,
being authenticated by, changing one's password for, and otherwise
maintaining users and groups on an embedded system. It also provides
shadow password support to enhance system security. TinyLogin is, as the
name implies, very small, and makes an excellent complement to BusyBox
on an embedded System. It can be used without BusyBox, of course, but I
envision them being used together most of the time.

Why is something like TinyLogin useful?

    [andersen@slag tinylogin]$ du -ch `which adduser deluser delgroup login sulogin passwd getty`
    24k     /usr/sbin/adduser
    34k     /bin/login
    9.0k    /sbin/sulogin
    26k     /usr/bin/passwd
    15k     /sbin/getty
    108k    total

    [andersen@slag tinylogin]$ ls -sh ./tinylogin
     35k ./tinylogin*

`nuff said.

TinyLogin is a curious blend of code from a whole bunch of folks. It
was originally cobbled together by Sean Bastille <hightide@ginch.org>
based in part on the May of 1998 version of the shadow utilities, which
can be downloaded from: ftp://ftp.ists.pwr.wroc.pl/pub/linux/shadow/
The build system, and the way in which TinyLogin invokes its component
applications has been totally rewritten, based on the build system used
for BusyBox. The code has also been majorly reworked to make it more
internally consistent, to make it use fewer global variables, etc, by
Erik Andersen.

TinyLogin may be used and distributed under the terms of GNU General
Public License, with the addition of the special terms enumerated below
by the shadow utilities license (a BSD style license which allows me
to make future releases under the GPL).

TinyLogin, like BusyBox, is now modularized to easily allow you to build
only the components you need, thereby reducing binary size. To turn off
unwanted TinyLogin components, simply edit the file Config.h and
comment out the parts you do not want using C++ style (//) comments.

After the build is complete a tinylogin.links file is generated which is
then used by 'make install' to create symlinks to the tinylogin binary
for all compiled in functions. By default, 'make install' will place a
symlink forest into `pwd`/_install unless you have defined the PREFIX
environment variable.
