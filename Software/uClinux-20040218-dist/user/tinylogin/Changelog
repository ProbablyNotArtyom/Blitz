0.80

	* Drop permissions when run setuid root (except when run as passwd 
	    or su).
	* A large update so you can now select from the Makefile whether or not
	    to use the system's passwd and group functions.  Since most systems
	    use GNU libc, this can save you from having to install the
	    /etc/nsswitch.conf configuration file and the required libnss_*
	    libraries.  Now, by default, tinylogin will directly use the
	    /etc/password and /etc/group (and I will get fewer emails asking
	    about how glibc NSS works :-).  Enabling this adds just 1.5k to the
	    binary size (which is a _lot_ less then glibc NSS costs).
	* 'make install' now creates relative symlinks, and added a new
	    'make install-hardlinks' target to (tada) install hardlinks.
	* Added a 'tinylogin --install' option, allowing tinylogin to
	    install all of its own symlinks (or hardlinks).
	* Updated all the usage information.
	* Build system brought into sync with latest from busybox
	* Added support for md5 and sha1 crypted passwords, thanks to
	    kilian.klimek@okay.net
	* Added vlock implementation by spoon <spoon@ix.netcom.com>
	* Added a patch from David Vrabel to use fcntl for file locking,
	    making the code smaller and making it work on jffs.
	* Renamed "tinylogin.def.h" to "Config.h".
	* Renamed "internal.h" to "tinylogin.h"
        * Fixed addgroup; it now does not add the new group if the name
	  is already in use.  Also made the usage statement accurate.
	* login now exits after three failed attempts

	* Libc5 support.  You still need to edit the Makefile though...
	* Reworked Makefile to do bring it back into sync with the way 
	    BusyBox does things.

            - login.c and myname.c don't rely on utmp functions;
 	      they now use ttyname() and getpwuid() rather than getlogin().
            - fixed some possible buffer overrun problems.
	    - su'ing to another from the root user no longer requests a password.
	    - fixed or commented (somethimes schizophrenic) return values in:
	        addgroup.c, adduser.c, deluser.c, getty.c, login.c
	        obscure.c, passwd.c, shadow.c
	      They should now conform with the normal convention
 	        (0=success, 1 or NULL=failure);
              (addgroup now returns 0 on success)
	    - Correctly handle non-standard crypt() functions from overrunning
	      buffers.
	    - The code used sleep() to delay after a wrong password without
	      checking the time (sleep is interruptable.)  It now checks.

	-Everett Robinson

	* Several more changes from Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org>
	    - It's now possable to disable `passwd' but use `adduser'. 
	    - When changing terminal permissions, ignore all errors (such as
		those emitted from a read-only root filesystem...) 
	    - Checking /etc/securetty can now be disabled.
	    - When TLG_FEATURE_SHADOWPASSWDS, code that should not be comiled
		is not properly not compiled in.
	    - Adjusted getty's debugging code to make it more useful.

	* Added debug messages to see what uid and euid _really_ are
	* Removed annoying fprintf(stderr, "\n") from tinylogin.c
	* adduser makes home dir
	* adduser invokes passwd_main()
	* Made aesthetic improvements to login message in login.c
	* Fixed a potential namespace aliasing problem in tinylogin.mkll
	* Fixed a bug in addgroup that would let one add the same
	  group more than once.
	* su implemented by making login_main() schizophrenic.
	  So far it supports only the -p (preserve env) option.
	* The lowest uid/gid adduser will allocate is now 100.
	* Cosmetic fix to getty from Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org>

	-Erik Andersen
	
0.76
	* Added prelinary adduser, deluser, addgroup, and delgroup 
	    implementations.  They're all usable, but a bit rough.
	    -beppu  -- John Beppu <beppu@lineo.com>
	* adduser and addgroup are a bit cleaner and they
	  support shadow (and gshadow), now.

	-Erik Andrsen, 10 January 2000

0.75
	* First release by me.  I'm taking over maintaining tinylogin
	    from Dave Cinege of the Linux Router Project, who
	    took it over from Sean Bastille <hightide@ginch.org>,
	    who based his work on the shadow utils suite.
	* Build system replaced with the build system from BusyBox
	* Modularized (same style as BusyBox) allowing individual apps
	    to be turned on or off.
	* Code reorganized, cleaned, and adjusted.
