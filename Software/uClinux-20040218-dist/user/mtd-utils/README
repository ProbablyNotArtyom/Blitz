This directorty holds a variety of utilities for creating filesystems,
testing flash device integrity and other fun stuff. In order to compile
these, the contents of this directory must reside in a directory off of
the root Linux kernel tree. There are two ways to accomplish this:

1) Create a symbolic link in the root of your kernel tree:

       ln -s utils <path-to-mtd-utils-directory>

2) Create a physical copy of the directory:

       cp -a utils <path-of-kernel-tree>

After you have done one of the above, go into the 'utils' directory
and simply type 'make' all of the utilities should build for you. If
you wish to cross-compile these utilities, you should only have to
set the environment variable 'CC' to the path/name of your GCC cross-
compiler.

Hope this helps.

There is now an additional compile-method available. Using automake/autoconf.
To compile the utilities the following should be sufficient:
!!! Attention: the old Makefile will be overwritten by configure !!!

automake --foreign                   the parameter is required because some
                                     files required by the GNU coding
				     guidelines are missing (i.e. NEWS).
autoconf
./configure --with-kernel=<path to kernel or mtd directory>
make
make install                         this installs the binaries in
                                     /usr/local/sbin by default
