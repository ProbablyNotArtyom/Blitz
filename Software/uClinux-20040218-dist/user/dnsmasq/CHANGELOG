release 0.4 - initial public release

release 0.5 - added caching, removed compiler warning on linux PPC

release 0.6 - TCP handling: close socket and return to connect state if we 
              can't read the first byte. This corrects a problem seen very 
              occasionally where dnsmasq would loop using all available CPU.

	      Added a patch from Cris Bailiff <c.bailiff@e-secure.com.au>
	      to set SO_REUSEADDR on the tcp socket which stops problems when
              dnsmasq is restarted and old connections still exist.

	      Stopped claiming in doc.html that smail is the default Debian
	      mailer, since it isn't any longer. (Pointed out by
	      David Karlin <dkarlin@coloradomtn.edu>)

release 0.7   Create a pidfile at /var/run/dnsmasq.pid

	      Extensive armouring against "poison packets" courtesy of
              Thomas Moestl <tmoestl@gmx.net>

	      Set sockaddr.sa_family on outgoing address, patch from
	      David Symonds <xoxus@usa.net>

              Patch to clear cache on SIGHUP 
	      from Jason L. Wagner <nialscorva@yahoo.com> 

	      Fix bad bug resulting from not initialising value-result	
	      address-length parameter to recvfrom() and accept() - it
	      worked by luck before!

release 0.95  Major rewrite: remove calls to gethostbyname() and talk
              directly to the upstream server(s) instead.
              This has many advantages.
              (1) Dnsmasq no longer blocks during long lookups.
              (2) All query types are handled now, (eg MX) not just internet
                  address queries. Addresses are cached, all other
                  queries are forwarded directly.
              (3) Time-to-live data from upstream server is read and
                  used by dnsmasq to purge entries from the cache.
              (4) /etc/hosts is still read and its contents served (unless 
	          the -h option is given).
              (5) Dnsmasq can get its upstream servers from
                  a file other than /etc/resolv.conf (-r option) this allows
                  dnsmasq to serve names to the machine it is running
                  on (put nameserver 127.0.0.1 in /etc/resolv.conf and
                  give dnsmasq the option -r /etc/resolv.dnsmasq)
              (6) Dnsmasq will re-read it's servers if the
                  modification time of resolv.conf changes. Along with
                  4 above this allows nameservers to be set
		  automatically by ppp or dhcp.	 

              A really clever NAT-like technique allows the daemon to have lots
              of queries in progress, but still remain very lightweight.
	      Dnsmasq has a small footprint and normally doesn't allocate
              any more memory after start-up. The NAT-like forwarding was
              inspired by a suggestion from Eli Chen <eli@routefree.com>

release 0.96  Fixed embarrasing thinko in cache linked-list code.
                             
release 0.98  Some enhancements and bug-fixes. 
              Thanks to "Denis Carre" <denis.carre@laposte.net> and Martin 
              Otte <otte@essc.psu.edu>	
              
	      (1) Dnsmasq now always sets the IP source address
                  of its replies correctly. Older versions would not always
                  do this on multi-homed and IP aliased hosts, which violates 
                  the RFC.
              (2) Dnsmasq no longer crashes if a server loop is created
	          (ie dnsmasq is told to use itself as an upstream server.)
                  Now it just logs the problem and doesn't use the bad 
                  server address.
              (3) Dnsmasq should now forward (but not cache) inverse queries 
                  and server status queries; this feature has not been tested.
              (4) Don't write the pid file when in non-daemon mode.
	      (5) Create the pid file mode 644, rather then 666 (!).
              (6) Generate queries to upstream nameservers with unpredictable
                  ids, to thwart DNS spoofers.
              (7) Dnsmasq no longer forwards queries when the 
	          "recursion desired" bit is not set in the header.
	      (8) Fixed getopt code to work on compliers with unsigned char.
              
release 0.991 Added -b flag: when set causes dnsmasq to always answer
	      reverse queries on the RFC 1918 private IP space itself and
              never forward them to an upstream server. If the name is not in
	      /etc/hosts, dnsmasq replies with the dotted-quad address.
              
              Fixed a bug which stopped dnsmasq working on a box with
              two or more interfaces with the same IP address. 

              Fixed cacheing of CNAMEs. Previously, a CNAME which pointed
              to  a name with many A records would not have all the addresses
              returned when being answered from the cache.

	      Thanks to "Steve Hardy" <s.a.hardy@connectux.com> for his input 
              on these fixes.

              Fixed race which could cause dnsmasq to miss the second of
              two closely-spaced updates of resolv.conf (Thanks to Eli Chen
              for pointing this out.)

	      Fixed a bug which could cause dnsmasq to fail to cache some
              dns names.

release 0.992 Small change to memory allocation so that names in /etc/hosts
              don't use cache slots. Also make "-c 0" flag meaningfully 
              disable caching completely.                            

release 0.993 Return only the first (canonical) name from an entry in
	      /etc/hosts as reply to reverse query.
              
              Handle wildcard queries for names/addresses in /etc/hosts
	      this is mainly to allow reverse lookups by dig to succeed.
	      (Bug reported by Simon J. Rowe" <srowe@mose.org.uk>)  
              
              Subtle change to the logic which selects which of multiple
	      upstream servers we send queries to. This fixes a problem 
              where dnsmasq continuously sends queries to a server which
	      is returning error codes and ignores one which is working.
              
release 0.994 Fixed bug which broke lookup of names in /etc/hosts
              which have upper-case letters in them. Thanks for Joao Clemente
              for spotting that one. 

	      Output cache statistics on receipt of SIGUSR1. These go
              to syslog except in debug (-d) mode, when a complete cache
	      dump goes to stdout. Suggestion from Joao Clemente, code
              based in John Volpe's.
              
	      Accept GNU long options on the command line. Code from 
	      John Volpe for this. 

              Split source code into multiple files and produced 
	      a proper makefile. 
              
              Included code from John Volpe to parse dhcp.leases file
              written by ISC dhcpd. The hostnames in the leases file are
              added to the cache and updated as dhcpd updates the 
              leases file. The code has been heavily re-worked by me,
              so any bugs are probably mine.

release 0.995 Small tidy-ups to signal handling and cache code.

release 0.996 Added negative caching: If dnsmasq gets a "no such domain" reply
              from an upstream nameserver, it will cache that information
              for a time specified by the SOA RR in the reply. See RFC 2308
              for details. This is useful with  resolver libraries
              which append assorted suffices to non-FQDN in an attempt to 
              resolve them, causing useless cache misses.

              Added -i flag, which restricts dnsmasq to offering name service
              only on specified interfaces.

release 0.997 Deleted INSTALL script and added "install" target to makefile.
              Stopped distributing binaries in the tarball to avoid 
              libc version clashes.
              Fixed  interface detection code to
              remove spurious startup errors in rare circumstances.
              Dnsmasq now changes its uid, irrevocably, to nobody after
              startup for security reasons. Thanks to Peter Bailey for
              this patch.
	      Cope with infinite DHCP leases. Patch thanks to 
	      Yaacov Akiba Slama.
	      Added rpm control files to .tar.gz distribution. Thanks to
              Peter Baldwin at ClarkConnect for those.
              Improved startup script for rpms. Thanks to Yaacov Akiba Slama.

release 1.0   Stable release: dnsmasq is now considered feature-complete
              and stable.
              
release 1.1   Added --user argument to allow user to change to
              a different userid.
              Added --mx-target argument to allow mail to be delivered
              away from the gateway machine running dnsmasq.
              Fixed highly  obscure bug with wildcard queries for
              DHCP lease derived names.
              Moved manpage from section 1 to section 8.
              Added --no-poll option.
              Added Suse-rpm support.
              Thanks to Joerg Mayer for the last two.

release 1.2   Added IPv6 DNS record support. AAAA records are cached
              and read from /etc/hosts. Reverse-lookups in the
	      ip6.int and ip6.arpa domains are suppored. Dnsmasq can
              talk to upstream servers via IPv6 if it finds IP6 addresses
              in /etc/resolv.conf and it offers DNS service automatically
              if IPv6 support is present in the kernel.
              Extended negative caching to NODATA replies.
              Re-vamped CNAME processing to cope with RFC 2317's use of
              CNAMES to PTR RRs in CIDR.
              Added config.h and a couple of symbols to aid
              compilation on non-linux systems.

release 1.3   Some versions of the Linux kernel return EINVAL rather
              then ENPROTONOSUPPORT when IPv6 is not available, 
              causing dnsmasq to bomb out. This release fixes that.
              Thanks to Steve Davis for pointing this one out.
              Trivial change to startup logic so that dnsmasq logs
              its stuff and reads config files straight away on
              starting, rather than after the first query - principle 
              of least surprise applies here.     

release 1.4   Fix a bug with DHPC lease parsing which broke in
              non-UTC timezones. Thanks to Mark Wormgoor for
              spotting and diagnosing this. Fixed versions in
              the .spec files this time. Fixed bug in Suse startup
              script. Thanks to Didi Niklaus for pointing this out.

release 1.5   Added --filterwin2k option which stops dnsmasq from forwarding
	      "spam" queries from win2k boxes. This is useful to stop spurious
              connections over dial-on-demand links. Thanks to Steve Hardy 
              for this code.
              Clear "truncated" bit in replies we return from upstream. This
              stops resolvers from switching to TCP, which is pointless since
              dnsmasq doesn't support TCP. This should solve problems
              in resolving hotmail.com domains.
              Don't include getopt.h when Gnu-long-options are disabled -
              hopefully this will allow compilation on FreeBSD.
	      Added the --listen-address and --pid-file flags.
              Fixed a bug which caused old entries in the DHCP leases file
              to be used in preference to current ones under certain
              circumstances.

release 1.6   If a machine gets named via DHCP and the DHCP name doesn't have
              a domain part and domain suffix is set using the -s flag, then
              that machine has two names with the same address, with and 
              without the domain suffix. When doing a _reverse_ lookup to
              get the name, the "without suffix" name used to be returned,
              now the "with suffix" one gets returned instead. This change
	      suggested by Arnold Schulz.
              Fixed assorted typos in the documentation. Thanks 
              to David Kimdon.
              Subtle rearrangement to the downloadable tarball, and stopped
              distributing .debs, since dnsmasq is now an official Debian
              package.

release 1.7   Fix a problem with cache not clearing properly
              on receipt of SIGHUP. Bug spotted by Sat Deshpande.
              In group-id changing code:
	      1) Drop supplimentary groups.
              2) Change gid before dropping root (patch from Soewono Effendi.)
              3) Change group to "dip" if it exists, to allow access
                 to /etc/ppp/resolv.conf (suggestion from Jorg Sommer.)
              Update docs to reflect above changes.
              Other documentation changes from David Miller.
              Added suggested script fragment for dhcpcd.exe.

release 1.8   Fix unsafe use of tolower() macro - allows linking against 
              ulibc. (Patches from Soewono Effendi and Bjorn Andersson.)
              Fix typo in usage string.
	      Added advice about RedHat PPP configuration to
              documentation. (Thanks to C. Lee Taylor.)
	      Patches to fix problems on BSD systems from Marc Huber
              and Can Erkin Acar. These add the options
              HAVE_ARC4RANDOM and HAVE_SOCKADDR_SA_LEN to config.h.
	      Elaborated config.h - should really use autoconf.
	      Fix time-to-live calculation when chasing CNAMEs.
	      Fix use-after-free and missing initialisation bugs in
              the cache code. (Thanks to Marc Huber.)
              Builds on Solaris 9. (Thanks to Marc Huber.)           

release 1.9   Fixes to rpm .spec files.
              Don't put expired DHCP entries into the cache only to 
	      throw them away again.
              Put dnsmasq on a severe memory diet: this reduces both
              the amount of heap space used and the stack size
              required. The difference is not really visible with
              bloated libcs like glibc, but should dramatically reduce
              memory requirements when linked against ulibc for use on
              embeded routers, and that's the point really. Thanks to
              Matthew Natalier for prompting this.   
	      Changed debug mode (-d) so that all logging appears on
              stderr as well as going to syslogd. 
	      Added HAVE_IPV6 config symbol to allow compilation
              against a libc which doesn't have IPv6 support.
	      Added a facility to log all queries, enabled with -q flag.
	      Fixed packet size checking bug in address extraction code.
	      Halved default cache size - 300 was way OTT in typical use.
	      Added self-MX function, enabled by -e flag. Thanks to
              Lyonel Vincent for the patch.
	      Added HAVE_FORK config symbol and stuff to support
              uClinux. Thanks to Matthew Natalier for uClinux stuff. 

release 1.10  Log warnings if resolv.conf or dhcp.leases are not
              accessable for any reason, as suggested by Hinrich Eilts.
	      Fixed wrong address printing in error message about
	      no interface with address.
	      Updated docs and split installation instuctions into setup.html.
	      Fix bug in CNAME chasing code: One CNAME pointing
	      to many A records would lose A records after the 
	      first. This bug was introduced in version 1.9.
	      Log startup failures at level Critical as well as 
	      printing them to standard error.
	      Exit with return code 1 when given bad options.
	      Cleaned up code for no-cache operation.
              Added -o option which forces dnsmasq to use to
              upstream servers in the order they appear in /etc/resolv.conf.
              Added upstream server use logging.
              Log full cache dump on receipt of SIGUSR1 when query 
              logging is enabled (-q switch).
	      Added -S option to directly specify upstream servers and
              added ability to direct queries for specific domains to
              specfic servers. Suggested by Jens Vonderheide.
	      Upgraded random ID generation - patch from Rob Funk.	      
	      Fixed reading of domains in arguments with capital
              letters or trailing periods.
	      Fixed potential SEGV when given bad options.
	      Read options from /etc/dnsmasq.conf if it exists.
              Do sensible things with missing parameters, eg 
              "--resolv-file=" turns off reading /etc/resolv.conf.
