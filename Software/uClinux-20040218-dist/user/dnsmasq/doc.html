<TITLE> Dnsmasq - a DNS forwarder for NAT firewalls.</TITLE>

<H1 ALIGN=center>Dnsmasq</H1> 
Dnsmasq is a caching DNS forwarder designed to provide DNS service on a 
small network. It is targeted at home networks using NAT and 
connected to the internet via a modem, cable-modem or ADSL
connection but would be a good choice for any small network where low
resource use and ease of configuration are important. 
<P>
Dnsmasq is included in at least the following Linux distributions: Gentoo, Debian,
Smoothwall, IP-Cop, floppyfw, and Firebox.
<P>
Dnsmasq provides the following features:
<DIR>

<LI> 
The DNS configuration of machines behind the firewall is simple and
doesn't depend on the details of the ISP's dns servers
<LI>
Clients which try to do DNS lookups while  a modem link to the
internet is down will time out immediately.
</LI>
<LI>
Dnsmasq will serve names from the /etc/hosts file on the firewall
machine: If the names of local machines are there, then they can all
be addressed without having to maintain /etc/hosts on each machine.
</LI>
<LI>
Dnsmasq will serve names from the DHCP leases file on the firewall machine:
If machines specify a hostname when they take out a DHCP lease, then they are
addressable in the local DNS.
</LI>
<LI>
Dnsmasq caches internet addresses (A records and AAAA records) and address-to-name
mappings (PTR records), reducing the load on upstream servers and
improving performance (especially on modem connections). From version
0.95 the cache honours time-to-live information and removes old
records as they expire. From version 0.996 dnsmasq does negative
caching. From version 1.2 dnsmasq supports IPv6 addresses, both
in its cache and in /etc/hosts.
</LI>
<LI>
Dnsmasq can be configured to automatically pick up the addresses of
it's upstream nameservers from ppp or dhcp configuration. It will
automatically reload this information if it changes. This facility
will be of particular interest to maintainers of Linux firewall
distributions since it allows dns configuration to be made automatic.
</LI>
<LI>
On IPv6-enabled boxes, dnsmasq can both talk to upstream servers via IPv6 
and offer DNS service via IPv6. On dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) boxes it talks
both protocols and can even act as IPv6-to-IPv4 or IPv4-to-IPv6 forwarder.
</LI>
<LI>
Dnsmasq can be configured to send queries for certain domains to
upstream servers handling only those domains. This makes integration
with private DNS systems easy.
</LI>
</DIR>
<P>
Dnsmasq has one further feature; it can be configured to return an MX record 
for the firewall host. This makes it easy to configure the mailer on the local 
machines to forward all mail to the central mailer on the firewall host. Never 
lose root messages from your machines again!
