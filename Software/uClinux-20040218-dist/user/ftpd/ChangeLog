	* ftp.c: Checks for HAVE_DECL variables must read
	  #if !HAVE_DECL_something, since AC_CHECK_DECLS always
	  declares HAVE_DECL, either to 0 or to 1. 	  
	* extern.h: Likewise.
	* ftpd.c: Likewise.

2002-04-29  Alfred M. Szmidt  <ams@kemisten.nu>

	* ftpd.c <version.h>: Include removed.
	(inetutils_package): Renamed to PACKAGE_NAME.
	(inetutils_version): Renamed to PACKAGE_VERSION.
	(inetutils_bugaddr): Renamed to PACKAGE_BUGREPORT.

2002-04-21  Alfred M. Szmidt <ams@kemisten.nu>

        * Makefile.am (inetdaemon_PROGRAMS): Use ftpd_BUILD instead of
        BUILD_FTPD.
        * extern.h [HAVE_GETUSERSHELL_DECL]: Renamed to HAVE_DECL_GETUSERSHELL.
        * ftpd.c [HAVE_FCLOSE_DECL]: Renamed to HAVE_DECL_FCLOSE.

2002-02-10  Jeff Bailey  <jbailey@outpost.dnsalias.org>

	* Makefile.am: Add -I$(top_builddir)/include to INCLUDES

	* .cvsignore: Add ftpcmd.c

2001-11-03  Alain Magloire

	* server_mode.c: [DEFPORT] defiine to 21.
	Fallback to DEFPORT if getservbyname() failed.
	Lots of site does not configure the /etc/services
	correctly.

2001-11-02  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* ftpd.c (complete_login): Add missing `;'.

2001-10-25  Sergey Poznyakoff

	* pam.c: Provide replacements for PAM_CONV_AGAIN and
	PAM_INCOMPLETE for systems that miss them (e.g. Solaris)

2001-08-27  Alain Magloire

	* Makefile.am: Add EXTRA_DIST = ftpcmd.c.  To force the
	generation of the file when doing the distribution.  This way
	YACC is no longer an requirement.

2001-08-25  Alain Magloire

	* Makefile.am: Check for LIBLS and add it to the link.
	* popen.c:  WITH_LIBLS check.

2000-10-31  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* ftpd.c: Remove PROGRAM, declare __PROGNAME. Remove COPYRIGHT
	(it's in the header) and "#if 0"-out SCCSID.
	(usage): Replace PROGRAM with __PROGNAME.
	(main): Likewise. Also initialize __PROGNAME if not HAVE___PROGNAME.

2000-10-30  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* ftpd.c: New variable PROGRAM.
	(usage): Frob it to behave like the syslogd usage(),
	so it gives the correct output.
	(main): Beautify option parsing code (more comments, proper
	use of usage). Reject unknown options instead ignoring them.
	Initialize PROGRAM and use it instead of argv.

2000-08-21  Alain Magloire

	The idea is to reduce the number of side effects i.e. reducing the
	number of global variables.  To help we regroup some of them in a
	structure call credentials, that is pass around.  The second approach
	to help detect side effects; when possible the variables are pass by
	parameter. All the gots of the authentication have move out
	elsewere(auth.c, pam.c) this will save us from the pesky #ifdef's.

	* ftpd.c: Passwd handling code removed.  PAM code removed.
	Variables guess, pw, logged_in, remotehost part of
	the credential structure.
	(end_login): Take the credential as an argument.
	(dolog): Likewise.
	(user): Call auth_user() to do the job.
	(pass): Call auth_pass() to do the job.
	(complete_login): Draft support for guest chroot.
	Do not display passwd part of setproctitle() and syslog() messages.
	(main): Remove on anonymous-name, was not use.
	* auth.c: New file.
	* Makefile.am: PATHDEF_FTPCHROOT in INCLUDES.
	* logwtmp.c: bzero replaced by memset.

Audit: Coding style to comply to GNU style, cleanup the code
to be ANSI C, provide the necessary prototypes, reinforce const
policy for strings, move functions definitions only where
they are use and make them static scope if possible, variables
not exported are change to static scope, all function declarations
are ANSI C and rely on ansi2knr for OS lacking, nuke non-portable
semantics, POSIX functions/behaviour are followed intead of BSD.
The definition for setproctitle is remove, this function is to
machine dependant and we did not get it right, if the OS supplies
we'll use it.  The approach later will be to provide a fairly
portable of setproctitle() and get configure to the rigth thing, with
AC_REPLACE_FUNC (setproctitle).

	* ftpd.c: allow_severity, deny_severity should be guarded
	with [HAVE_TCPD_H].
	Move all globals to <extern.h>.
	Remove [SETPROCTITLE] add [HAVE_SETPROCTITLE]
	[HAVE_INITSETPROCTITLE], remove setproctitle () definition.
	(main): SA_LEN () macro not portable remove.
	Variable "quiet" change for "no_version".
	(reapchild): Use waitpid ().
	(user): Remove previous code handling of PAM.
	and move the relevant pieces to sgetpwnam ().
	(user): when strncpy ()ing curname make sure we
	null terminate the string.
	(user): complete_login () call removed form user ().
	(delete): Use the portable S_ISDIR () marcro.
	(main): Don't typecast signal () use SIG_ERR.
	(display_file): New function.
	(statcmd): Global variable mode, rename to the
	more informative stru_mode, it was also shadowing a lot
	of local variable mode, for fopen ().
	(main):  Remove initialization of global
	variables and initialize when defined.
	(main): New option '-p' to override pid file.
	(main): Adding SO_KEEPALIVE, to let the tcp/ip stack
	detect when the connection been drop, IPTOS_LOWDELAY
	for the control connection and IPTOS_THROUGHPUT for
	the data connection.

	* ftpcmd.y: Remove definition of yyerror () from ftpd.c
	and move it to ftpcmd.y, result "cbuf" static scope.
	Move all globals to <extern.h>.
	Move declaration of cmdtab[] and sitetab[] to <extern.h>.

	* conf.c: New file, define checkuser () and display_file ().

	* pam.c: New file, define PAM related functions.

	* wrap.c: New file, define TCPD related functions.

	* server.c: New file, move all related standalone function to
	this module reapchild (), server_mode () and tcpd wrapper handling.

2000-08-10  Michael Vogt <mvo@debian.org>

	* ftpd/ftpd.c: cleaned up PAM code.

2000-07-30  Alain Magloire

	* ftpd.c: protect initgroups() with HAVE_INITGROUPS.

2000-07-30  Michael Vogt <mvo@debian.org>

	* ftpd.c(main): added TCP_WRAPPER support for daemon mode.

2000-07-26  Michael Vogt  <mvo@debian.org>

	* ftpd.c(pass): added pam support.

2000-07-08  Michael Vogt  <mvo@debian.org>

	* ftpd.c(main): added new option "-A" anonymous login only
	added new option "-q" quiet to  do not print ftpd version.

2000-07-08  Michael Vogt  <mvo@debian.org>

	* ftpd.c(main): added new option "-D" for daemon-mode,
	ftpd can now run without inetd.

2000-07-07 Alain Magloire

	* ftpd.c(sgetpwnam()): if HAVE_GETSPNAM && HAVE_SHADOW_H, call
	getspnam() to get the encrypted passwd.

2000-07-06 Michel Vogt

	* popen.c: Instead of spwaning "/bin/ls" use the internal ls
	from libls.a.

	* ftpd.c: use setproctitle ("%s", protittle);

2000-07-05 Alain Magloire

	* *: Clause 3 removed.

	The security fixes are gather from different sources:
	folks of OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Debian, Redhat and wu-ftpd.
	Heads-up for their nice work.


	* popen.c : overflow in argv[] and gargv[] fix.

1999-02-17 Alain Magloire

	* ftpd.c(send_data): Use mmap() if possible, HAVE_MMAP.
	* extern.h : Add toolong() to be exported.
	* ftpcmnd.y : toolong() no longer a static function.
	* ftpd.c : Set the alarm(timeout) when doing an accept() for
	the data port and use signal(SIGALRM, toolong).
	* ftpd.c(maing): tzset(), in case no timezone database in ~ftp.
	* ftpd.c(datacon) : Use snprintf() instead of sprintf() for
	fix array buffers. Assign *sizebuf ='\0' instead of
	strcpy (sizebuf, "");
	* Use xgetcwd() from libinetutils instead of getcwd();

1999-02-13 Alain Magloire

	* ftpcmd.y : PORT command disallow PORT if :
		- port <= 1023 || data_addr.sin_addr != his_addr.sin_addr
	This will take care of FTP bounce. See README.sec
	* ftpcmd.y : PASS clear passwd var(memset) asap.
	* ftpcmd.y : PASV check if loggin.
	* ftpcmd.y : RNTO check loggin and free $4 pointer.
	* ftpcmd.y : HELP free $3 pointer.
	* ftpcmd.y : SITE free $5 pointer.
	* ftpcmd.y : RNFR free $4 pointer.
	* ftpcmd.y : MDTM year 2000 compliant use %04d (tm_year + 1900).
	* ftpcmd.y : SITE IDLE not permit to disable timeout and check login.
