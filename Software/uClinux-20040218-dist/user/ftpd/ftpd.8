Internet File Transfer Protocol server 
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ftpd
.Op Fl dlADq
.Op Fl T Ar maxtimeout
.Op Fl t Ar timeout
.Op Fl a Ar login-name
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Ftpd
is the
Internet File Transfer Protocol
server process.  The server uses the
.Tn TCP
protocol
and listens at the port specified in the
.Dq ftp
service specification; see
.Xr services 5 .
.Pp
Available options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Debugging information is written to the syslog 
using LOG_FTP.
.It Fl l
Each successful and failed
.Xr ftp 1
session is logged using syslog with a facility of LOG_FTP.
If this option is specified twice, the retrieve (get), store (put), append,
delete, make directory, remove directory and rename operations and
their filename arguments are also logged.
.It Fl A 
Only anonymous login is allowed.
.It Fl D
ftpd enters daemon-mode. That allows ftpd to be run without inetd.
.It Fl q
Quiet mode. No information about the version of the ftpd is given to the 
client.
.It Fl T
A client may also request a different timeout period;
the maximum period allowed may be set to
.Ar timeout
seconds with the
.Fl T
option.
The default limit is 2 hours.
.It Fl t
The inactivity timeout period is set to
.Ar timeout
seconds (the default is 15 minutes).
.It Fl a
Give anonymous an other 
.Ar login-name 
(anonymous and ftpd will still work).
.El
.Pp
The file
.Pa /etc/nologin
can be used to disable ftp access.
If the file exists,
.Nm
displays it and exits.
If the file
.Pa /etc/ftpwelcome
exists,
.Nm
prints it before issuing the
.Dq ready
message.
If the file
.Pa /etc/motd
exists,
.Nm
prints it after a successful login.
.Pp
The ftp server currently supports the following ftp requests.
The case of the requests is ignored.
.Bl -column "Request" -offset indent
.It Request Ta "Description"
.It ABOR Ta "abort previous command"
.It ACCT Ta "specify account (ignored)"
.It ALLO Ta "allocate storage (vacuously)"
.It APPE Ta "append to a file"
.It CDUP Ta "change to parent of current working directory"
.It CWD Ta "change working directory"
.It DELE Ta "delete a file"
.It HELP Ta "give help information"
.It LIST Ta "give list files in a directory" Pq Dq Li "ls -lgA"
.It MKD Ta "make a directory"
.It MDTM Ta "show last modification time of file"
.It MODE Ta "specify data transfer" Em mode
.It NLST Ta "give name list of files in directory"
.It NOOP Ta "do nothing"
.It PASS Ta "specify password"
.It PASV Ta "prepare for server-to-server transfer"
.It PORT Ta "specify data connection port"
.It PWD Ta "print the current working directory"
.It QUIT Ta "terminate session"
.It REST Ta "restart incomplete transfer"
.It RETR Ta "retrieve a file"
.It RMD Ta "remove a directory"
.It RNFR Ta "specify rename-from file name"
.It RNTO Ta "specify rename-to file name"
.It SITE Ta "non-standard commands (see next section)"
.It SIZE Ta "return size of file"
.It STAT Ta "return status of server"
.It STOR Ta "store a file"
.It STOU Ta "store a file with a unique name"
.It STRU Ta "specify data transfer" Em structure
.It SYST Ta "show operating system type of server system"
.It TYPE Ta "specify data transfer" Em type
.It USER Ta "specify user name"
.It XCUP Ta "change to parent of current working directory (deprecated)"
.It XCWD Ta "change working directory (deprecated)"
.It XMKD Ta "make a directory (deprecated)"
.It XPWD Ta "print the current working directory (deprecated)"
.It XRMD Ta "remove a directory (deprecated)"
.El
.Pp
The following non-standard or
.Tn UNIX
specific commands are supported
by the
SITE request.
.Pp
.Bl -column Request -offset indent
.It Sy Request Ta Sy Description
.It UMASK Ta change umask, e.g. ``SITE UMASK 002''
.It IDLE Ta set idle-timer, e.g. ``SITE IDLE 60''
.It CHMOD Ta change mode of a file, e.g. ``SITE CHMOD 755 filename''
.It HELP Ta give help information.
.El
.Pp
The remaining ftp requests specified in Internet RFC 959
are
recognized, but not implemented.
MDTM and SIZE are not specified in RFC 959, but will appear in the
next updated FTP RFC.
.Pp
The ftp server will abort an active file transfer only when the
ABOR
command is preceded by a Telnet "Interrupt Process" (IP)
signal and a Telnet "Synch" signal in the command Telnet stream,
as described in Internet RFC 959.
If a
STAT
command is received during a data transfer, preceded by a Telnet IP
and Synch, transfer status will be returned.
.Pp
.Nm Ftpd
interprets file names according to the
.Dq globbing
conventions used by
.Xr csh 1 .
This allows users to utilize the metacharacters
.Dq Li \&*?[]{}~ .
.Pp
.Nm Ftpd
authenticates users according to three rules.
.Pp
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It
The login name must be in the password data base,
.Pa /etc/passwd ,
and not have a null password.
In this case a password must be provided by the client before any
file operations may be performed.
.It
The login name must not appear in the file
.Pa /etc/ftpusers .
.It
The user must have a standard shell returned by
.Xr getusershell 3 .
.It
If the user name is
.Dq anonymous
or
.Dq ftp ,
an
anonymous ftp account must be present in the password
file (user
.Dq ftp ) .
In this case the user is allowed
to log in by specifying any password (by convention an email address for
the user should be used as the password).
.El
.Pp
In the last case,
.Nm ftpd
takes special measures to restrict the client's access privileges.
The server performs a
.Xr chroot 2
to the home directory of the
.Dq ftp
user.
In order that system security is not breached, it is recommended
that the
.Dq ftp
subtree be constructed with care, following these rules:
.Bl -tag -width "~ftp/pub" -offset indent
.It Pa ~ftp
Make the home directory owned by
.Dq root
and unwritable by anyone.
.ne 1i
.It Pa ~ftp/bin
Make this directory owned by
.Dq root
and unwritable by anyone (mode 555).
The program
.Xr ls 1
must be present to support the list command.
This program should be mode 111.
.It Pa ~ftp/etc
Make this directory owned by
.Dq root
and unwritable by anyone (mode 555).
The files
.Xr passwd 5
and
.Xr group 5
must be present for the
.Xr ls
command to be able to produce owner names rather than numbers.
The password field in
.Xr passwd
is not used, and should not contain real passwords.
The file
.Pa motd ,
if present, will be printed after a successful login.
These files should be mode 444.
.It Pa ~ftp/pub
Make this directory mode 777 and owned by
.Dq ftp .
Guests
can then place files which are to be accessible via the anonymous
account in this directory.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/ftpwelcome -compact
.It Pa /etc/ftpusers
List of unwelcome/restricted users.
.It Pa /etc/ftpwelcome
Welcome notice.
.It Pa /etc/motd
Welcome notice after login.
.It Pa /etc/nologin
Displayed and access refused.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Xr getusershell 3 ,
.Xr syslogd 8
.Sh BUGS
The server must run as the super-user
to create sockets with privileged port numbers.  It maintains
an effective user id of the logged in user, reverting to
the super-user only when binding addresses to sockets.  The
possible security holes have been extensively
scrutinized, but are possibly incomplete.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
