* clone doesn't work; cloned processes can hang
* partially done: finish up change_syscall using new setargs
* do setargs for non-ia64
* generate syscallent.h from the kernel sources (asm/unistd.h)
* update linux/sparc syscall entries; Linux messed things up by overriding
  all kinds of SunOS entries
* synchronize linux/**/syscallent.h, number of arguments for a syscal isn't
  consistent across different architectures
