Changes in 4.4
==============
* Fix Linux/ia64 support, looks like someone renamed a few things on us
* Fix the ioctl setup for Linux, turned out it did not really work.
  Improve the ioctl extracter as well so we decode some more ones.

Changes in 4.3.1
================
* compile fixes for Linux/mips

Changes in 4.3
==============
* Linux ia64 and hppa ports added
* The usual Linux syscall updates (includes 32bit uid/gid support),
* Linux ioctl list updated
* Support IPv6 scope ids
* FreeBSD/i386 port added
* UnixWare and Solaris updates
* Better support for tracing multithreaded processes in Linux

Changes in 4.2
==============
* Compiles on glibc2.0 systems again
* Linux/S390 port added
* The usual Linux syscall updates 
* we can follow fork on arm now

Changes in 4.1
================
* Linux/MIPS port added
* Lots of Linux updates again
* Improved IPv6 support
* Add strace-graph

Changes in 4.0.1
================
* Minor bugfixes
* Compiles on glibc2.0 systems again

Changes in 4.0
==============
* Get stat structure properly on Linux 64bit archs
* Personalities work again
* Compile correctly on SunOS again
* IRIX64 updates
* Solaris updates

Changes in 3.99.1
=================
* Linux (ultra)sparc fixes
* Linux alpha fixes
* Minor cleanups

Changes in 3.99
===============
* New maintainer
* add support for more Linux architectures (powerpc, sparc, arm)
* support lots more Linux syscalls
* fix signal handling
* add IPX and IPIP support
* check stray syscall after execv
* fix hanging children

Changes in version 3.1
======================

* Irix5 is supported
* Linux 68k is supported
* Linux alpha is supported
* configure is upgraded to autoconf 2.x
* using -f in combination with -e now works correctly
* output can be piped to a program
* tracing setuid programs works better
* it is now reasonable to install strace setuid to root in some circumstances
* new useful tracing names like file and process to trace whole
  classes of system calls, e.g. -efile traces all system calls that
  take a file name as an argument
* IPC calls on SunOS 4.1.x are decoded
* Linux program memory is reliably dereferenced
* Linux decodes at least the name of all syscalls as of pre2.0.4
* various cosmetic changes and bug fixes

Changes from versions 2.x to version 3.0
========================================

* filename arguments are neither abbreviated nor stringified
* string arguments are now true C strings using octal instead of hex by default
* preprocessor constants are never shortened (e.g. was RDONLY => now O_RDONLY)
* by default the output for multiple processes now goes into one file
* all structures, vectors, bitsets, etc. use consistent output formats
* the -c option now means count calls, -i does what the old -c used to do

New Features in version 3.0
===========================

* non-ascii strings can be optionally printed entirely in hex
* the output format is readable when mutiple processes are generating output
* exit values are printed in an alignment column
* is is possible to suppress messages about attaching and detaching
* various tracing features can be enabled on a per syscall/signal/desc basis
* selective tracing of syscalls
* selective printing of syscall structures
* selective abbreviation of long structures on a per syscall basis
* selective printing of raw syscall arguments and results
* selective tracing of signals
* selective dumping of all I/O read from file descriptors
* selective dumping of all I/O written to file descriptors
* optional counting of time, calls, and errors for each syscall
