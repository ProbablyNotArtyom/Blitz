FOLLOW THESE STEPS:

0) There may be some outstanding bugfixes or tweaks which are not yet
   in the official kernel.  Those are now (as of iptables-1.2.7) kept
   in a seperate package, called patch-o-matic.  It is available from
   ftp://ftp.netfilter.org/pub/patch-o-matic/

1) Next, make the package.
	% make KERNEL_DIR=<<where-you-built-your-kernel>>

2) Finally, you need to to install the shared libraries, and the binary:
	# make install KERNEL_DIR=<<where-you-built-your-kernel>>

If you are a developer, you can install the headers, development libraries
and associated development man pages, with:
	# make install-devel

That's it!
================================================================
PROBLEMS YOU MAY ENCOUNTER:

1) This package requires a 2.4.4 kernel, or above.

2) If you get the kernel directory wrong, you may see a message like:
	Please try `make KERNEL_DIR=path-to-correct-kernel'

3) If you want to specify alternate directories for installation
(instead of /usr/local/ bin lib man), do this:

	% make BINDIR=/usr/bin LIBDIR=/usr/lib MANDIR=/usr/man
	# make BINDIR=/usr/bin LIBDIR=/usr/lib MANDIR=/usr/man install

4) If you want to build a statically linked version of the iptables binary,
   without the need for loading the plugins at runtime (e.g. for an embedded
   device or router-on-a-disk), please use

	% make NO_SHARED_LIBS=1

NOTE: make sure you build with at least the correct LIBDIR=
specification, otherwise iptables(8) won't know where to find the
dynamic objects.
