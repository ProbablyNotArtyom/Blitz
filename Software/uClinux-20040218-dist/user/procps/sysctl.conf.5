.SH NAME
sysctl.conf \- sysctl(8) preload/configuration file 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I sysctl.conf
is a simple file containing sysctl values to be read in and set by sysctl(8).
The syntax is simply as follows:
.RS
.sp
.nf
.ne 7
# comment
; comment

  token  =   value
.fi
.sp
.RE
.PP
Note that blank lines are ignored, and whitespace before and after a token or
value is ignored, although a value can contain whitespace within.  Lines which
begin with a # or ; are considered comments and ignored.
.SH EXAMPLE
.RS
.sp
.nf
.ne 7
# sysctl.conf sample
#

  kernel.domainname = example.com
; this one has a space which will be written to the sysctl!
  kernel.modprobe = /sbin/mod probe
