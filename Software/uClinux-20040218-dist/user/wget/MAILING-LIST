                          Mailing List Info

Thanks to Karsten Thygesen from Sunsite Denmark, Wget has a mailing
list for discussion and announcements.  The list address is
<wget@sunsite.auc.dk>.  To subscribe, send mail to
<wget-subscribe@sunsite.auc.dk>.

The list is fairly low-volume -- one or two messages per day and with
sporadic periods of intensive activity.  If you are interested in
using or hacking Wget, or wish to read the important announcements,
you are very welcome to subscribe.

The list is archived at <URL:http://fly.srk.fer.hr/archive/wget>.

NOTE: The list allows posts from non-subscribers.  This is
intentional; I hate having to subscribe to a list if I only want to
ask a single question.  If you're not subscribed to the list and ask
something, don't forget to request that the responses be Cc'ed to you.

As of this writing, the address <bug-wget@gnu.org> is an alias for
<wget@sunsite.auc.dk>.
