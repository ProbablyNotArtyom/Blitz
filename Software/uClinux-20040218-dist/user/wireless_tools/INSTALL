Very important note :
-------------------
	This release of the Wireless Tools is not compatible with Wireless
	Extensions earlier than 9.
	Kernels that support this version of the Wireless Tools are listed
	below. For all kernels before that, please use the version v19 of
	the Wireless Tools.
	You might have headers troubles and it doesn't compile, see below...

You need :
--------
	o Compiler and development environment
	o A kernel supporting wireless extensions version 9 or higher
		-> from 2.2.14 onward
		-> from 2.3.24 onward
		Note : CONFIG_NET_RADIO must be enabled
	o (Optional) A Pcmcia package supporting Wireless Extension
	o A driver supporting wireless extensions
		-> Wavelan isa
		-> Wavelan pcmcia
		-> Netwave pcmcia
		-> Wavelan IEEE pcmcia drivers
		-> Aironet MPL driver
		-> Proxim RangeLan2/Symphony driver
		-> Raylink/WegGear2.4 driver
		-> Check my web page for latest list of drivers,
			otherwise patch your favourite driver...
	Note : more recent kernels and drivers are likely to support
		more wireless extension features...

Recommended versions :
--------------------
	This are the latest updates of the Wireless Extensions :
	o Kernel (wireless extension definition) :
		-> Kernel 2.2.14 onward
		-> Kernel 2.3.24 onward
	o Pcmcia package :
		-> Pcmcia 3.1.15 onward
	o Drivers with wireless extension support :
		-> Wavelan isa from kernels above
		-> Wavelan pcmcia from pcmcia 3.1.1 onward
		-> Netwave pcmcia from pcmcia 3.1.2 onward
		-> Wavelan IEEE pcmcia GPL driver (wvlan_cs) 1.0.5 onward
		-> Aironet MPL driver (airo_cs.c) 1.4 onward
		-> Proxim RangeLan2/Symphony driver 1.4.3 onward
		-> Raylink/WegGear2.4 driver 1.70 (note : read only)

Compile wireless tools :
----------------------
	In theory, a "make" should suffice to create the tools.
	In practice, there is big troubles with the kernel
headers. See below for how to fix that.
	Note : as some internal data structures change from kernel to
kernel, you are advised to not use the precompiled version of the
tools but to recompile your own.

Installation :
------------
	If I were you, I would not trust a "make install". If you feel
courageous, just do "make install". It may even do the right thing.
	I advise to copy the executable (iwconfig, iwspy and iwpriv)
in /usr/local/sbin or /usr/sbin. The man pages (iwconfig.8, iwspy.8
and iwpriv.8) should be copied in /usr/local/man/man8 or
/usr/man/man8.
	In fact, if you want to use Pcmcia wireless.opts, this step is
mandatory...

Kernel headers (why it doesn't compile) :
---------------------------------------
	Some changes in the kernel headers and glibc headers are
making my life difficult.
	If you have glibc and kernel 2.2.X headers (or greater), that
should be all right. This is the default for most modern distributions.
	In the other cases, depending on which version of the kernel
headers (might be different from kernel) and library headers you have,
you need to play with the options at the top of the Makefile.

	The second issue is that some distributions install some
independant kernel headers in /usr/include. If you upgrade your
kernel, those headers become out of sync and you don't benefit from
the latest Wireless Extensions. Even worse, it can sometimes prevent
the tools from compiling.
	The trick is to copy the file .../include/linux/wireless.h
from the kernel to the /usr/include headers.
	A similar procedure may be used to update Wireless Extensions
in an older kernel...
