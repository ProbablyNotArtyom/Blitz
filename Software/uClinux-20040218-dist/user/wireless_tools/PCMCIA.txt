	One of the most exciting thing having happen after release 20
is the addition of Wireless Extension support in the Pcmcia init
scripts. Here is a quick intro on the subject...

Pre-requisite :
-------------
	o Pcmcia package with Wireless Extension support : 3.1.15 onward
	o A driver with Wireless Extension support
	o The tools (iwconfig and co.) installed in the /usr/local/sbin
		or /usr/sbin

Raylink driver :
--------------
	The Raylink driver as of 1.70 doesn't support yet writable
Wireless Extensions, so enabling wireless.opts on this driver will
make thing worse.

Pcmcia precompiled package :
--------------------------
	The Pcmcia package part of many distributions, especially
those from Red-Hat, include some weird init scripts. Because of this,
the present feature won't work.
	On the other hand, the Pcmcia package in source form from the
official Linux-Pcmcia web site will install the proper init scripts.

Basic support :
-------------
	The file /etc/pcmcia/wireless.opts contain some templates for
the most common drivers. Just fill in your card configuration in the
template corresponding to your driver configuration.
	Then, to activate it, you just need to remove or comment the 4
lines at the top of wireless.opts and restart the Pcmcia package.

	Things to take care of :
	The options of wireless.opts will be used directly as
arguments of iwconfig. So, you need iwconfig, and you need to check
the man page of iwconfig to know how to format them.
	A quick way to determine the correct options without
restarting Pcmcia is to play a bit with iwconfig directly to see what
is possible and what is the proper setup of the card and to copy that
in wireless.opts.
	At the end of wireless.opts, there is also a generic template
containing all the possible options and explaining their meaning. Not
all of them are supported by all cards (actually, most cards support a
limited subset of it).
	The current card templates are designed to match the MAC
address of the card. Please check that this matches with your card.
	Also, sample describe the most common/useful options available
with the card, for more advance option, borrow options from the
template. You can also remove some options, the card will usually
initialise with a sane value.

	Alternatively, you can also discard the current wireless.opts
and replace it with a file looking like this :
----------- wireless.opts ---------------------
case "$ADDRESS" in
*,*,*,*)
    ESSID="MY_ESSID"
    MODE="Managed"
    ;;
esac
-----------------------------------------------


Scheme support :
--------------
	The file wireless.opts fully support schemes. This allow you
to define different configurations (home, work...) and to switch on
the fly between them.
	The best way to explain it is to show an example.
	Let's say you have an infrastructured setup at work (MY_WORK)
and an adhoc network at home (MY_HOME). Moreover, when a specific card
is inserted, you want it to be in adhoc mode (TEST). The work setup
will be the default...

	Each Wireless LAN will have the following configuration :
--------- wireless.opts --------------------
# Lucent Wavelan IEEE - Ad-Hoc mode for test card
*,*,*,00:60:1D:03:9F:2D)
    ESSID="TEST"
    MODE="Ad-Hoc"
    FREQ="10"
    RATE="1M"
    ;;

# Lucent Wavelan IEEE - Ad-Hoc mode at home
home,*,*,00:60:1D:*|home,*,*,00:02:2D:*)
    ESSID="MY_HOME"
    MODE="Ad-Hoc"
    FREQ="5"
    ;;

# Lucent Wavelan IEEE - infrastructured mode at work
*,*,*,00:60:1D:*|*,*,*,00:02:2D:*)
    ESSID="MY_WORK"
    MODE="Managed"
    KEY="s:verysecurekey"
    ;;
--------------------------------------------

	Don't forget the IP configuration :
--------- network.opts ---------------------
# Wavelan IEEE : ad-hoc mode for test card
*,*,*,00:60:1D:03:9F:2D)
    DHCP="n"
    IPADDR="10.0.0.1"
    NETMASK="255.255.255.0"
    NETWORK="10.0.0.0"
    BROADCAST="10.0.0.255"
    ;;

# Wavelan IEEE : ad-hoc mode at home
home,*,*,00:60:1D:*|home,*,*,00:02:2D:*)
    DHCP="n"
    IPADDR="10.0.1.19"
    NETMASK="255.255.255.0"
    NETWORK="10.0.1.0"
    BROADCAST="10.0.1.255"
    GATEWAY="15.0.1.1"
    ;;

# Wavelan IEEE : infrastructured mode at work
*,*,*,00:60:1D:*|*,*,*,00:02:2D:*)
    DHCP="y"
    ;;
--------------------------------------------

	Now, when you are at work you do :
> cardctl scheme default
	And at home, you do :
> cardctl scheme home

	I guess you get the idea ;-)
