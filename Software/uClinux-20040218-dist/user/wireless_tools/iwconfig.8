.\" DESCRIPTION part
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Iwconfig
is similar to
.IR ifconfig (8),
but is dedicated to the wireless interfaces. It is used to set the
parameters of the network interface which are specific to the wireless
operation (for example : the frequency).
.B Iwconfig
may also be used to display those parameters, and the wireless
statistics (extracted from
.IR /proc/net/wireless ).
.PP
All these parameters and statistics are device dependant. Each driver
will provide only some of them depending on the hardware support, and
the range of value may change. Please refer to the man page of each
device for details.

.\"
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.B essid
Set the ESSID (or Network Name - in some products it may also called
Domain ID). The ESSID is used to identify cells which are part of the
same virtual network.
.br
As opposed to the NWID which defines a single cell, the ESSID defines
a group of cell connected via repeaters or infrastructure, where the
user may roam.  With some card, you may disable the ESSID checking
(ESSID promiscuous) with
.IR off " or " any " (and " on
to reenable it).
.br
.B Examples :
.br
.I "	iwconfig eth0 essid any"
.br
.I "	iwconfig eth0 essid ""My Network""
.TP
.BR nwid / domain
Set the Network ID (in some products it is also called Domain ID). As
all adjacent wireless networks share the same medium, this parameter
is used to differenciate them (create logical colocated networks) and
identify nodes belonguing to the same cell. With some card, you may
disable the Network ID checking (NWID promiscuous) with
.IR off " (and " on
to reenable it).
.br
.B Examples :
.br
.I "	iwconfig eth0 nwid AB34
.br
.I "	iwconfig eth0 nwid off"
.TP
.BR freq / channel
Set the operating frequency or channel in the device. Value below 1000
are the channel number, value over this is the frequency in Hz. You
must append the suffix k, M or G to the value (for example, "2.46G"
for 2.46 GHz frequency), or add enough '0'.
.br
Channels are usually numbered starting at 1,
and you may use
.IR iwpriv (8)
to get the total number of channels and list the available
frequencies. Depending on regulations, some frequencies/channels may
not be available.
.br
.B Examples :
.br
.I "	iwconfig eth0 freq 2.422G"
.br
.I "	iwconfig eth0 channel 3"
.TP
.B sens
Set the sensitivity threshold. This is the lowest signal level for
which we attempt a packet reception, signal lower than this are not
received. This is used to avoid receiving background noise, so you
should set it according to the average noise level. Positive values
are assumed to be the raw value used by the hardware or a percentage,
negative values are assumed to be dBm.
.br
With some hardware, this parameter also control the defer threshold
(lowest signal level for which we consider the channel busy) and the
handover threshold (lowest signal level where we stay associated with
the current access point).
.br
.B Example :
.br
.I "	iwconfig eth0 sens -80"
.TP
.B mode
Set the operating mode of the device, which depends on the network
topology. The mode can be
.I Ad-hoc
(network composed of only one cell and without Access Point),
.I Managed
(network composed of many cells, with roaming or with an Access Point),
.I Master
(the node is the synchronisation master or act as an Access Point),
.I Repeater
(the node forward packets on the air),
.I Secondary
(the node act as a backup master/repeater) or
.IR Auto .
.br
.B Example :
.br
.I "	iwconfig eth0 mode Managed"
.TP
.B ap
Register to the Access Point given by the address, if it is
possible. When the quality of the connection goes too low, the driver
may revert back to automatic mode.
.br
.B Example :
.br
.I "	iwconfig eth0 ap 00:60:1D:01:23:45"
.TP
.BR nick [name]
Set the nickname, or the station name. Most 802.11 products do define
it, but this is not used as far as the protocols (MAC, IP, TCP) are
concerned and completely accessory as far as configuration goes. In
fact only some diagnostic tools may use it.
.br
.B Example :
.br
.I "	iwconfig eth0 nickname ""My Linux Node""
.TP
.BR rate / bit [rate]
For cards supporting multiple bit rates, set the bit-rate in b/s. The
bit-rate is the speed at which bits are transmitted over the medium,
the user speed of the link is lower due to medium sharing and
overhead.
.br
You must append the suffix k, M or G to the value (decimal multiplier
: 10^3, 10^6 and 10^9 b/s), or add enough '0'. Values below 1000 are
card specific, usually an index in the bit-rate list. Use
.I auto
to select the automatic bit-rate mode (fallback to lower rate on noisy
channels), which is the default for most cards, and
.I fixed
to revert back to fixed setting. If you specify a bit-rate value and append
.IR auto ,
the driver will use all bit lower and equal than this value.
.br
.B Examples :
.br
.I "	iwconfig eth0 rate 11M"
.br
.I "	iwconfig eth0 rate auto"
.TP
.BR rts [_threshold]
RTS/CTS adds a handshake before each packet transmission to make sure
that the channel is clear. This adds overhead, but increase
performance in case of hidden nodes or large number of active
nodes. This parameters set the size of the smallest packet for which
the node sends RTS, a value equal to the maximum packet size disable
the scheme. You may also set this parameter to
.IR auto ", " fixed " or " off .
.br
.B Examples :
.br
.I "	iwconfig eth0 rts 250"
.br
.I "	iwconfig eth0 rts off"
.TP
.BR frag [mentation_threshold]
Fragmentation allow to split a IP packet in a burst of smaller
fragments transmitted on the medium. In most cases this adds overhead,
but in very noisy environment this reduce the error penalty. This
parameter set the maximum fragment size, a value equal to the maximum
packet size disable the scheme. You may also set this parameter to
.IR auto ", " fixed " or " off .
.br
.B Examples :
.br
.I "	iwconfig eth0 frag 512"
.br
.I "	iwconfig eth0 frag off"
.TP
.BR key / enc [ryption]
Used to manipulate encryption or scrambling keys and encryption mode.
.br
To set the current encryption key, just enter the key in hex digits as
.IR XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX " or " XXXXXXXX .
To set a key other than the current key, append
.I [index]
to the key itself. You can also enter the key as an ASCII string by
using the
.I s:
prefix.
.br
To change which key is the current active key, just enter
.I [index]
(without entering any key value).
.br
.IR off " and " on
disable and reenable encryption,
.I open
set the system in open mode (accept non-encrypted packets) and
.I restricted
discard non-encrypted packets.
.br
.B Examples :
.br
.I "	iwconfig eth0 key 0123-4567-89"
.br
.I "	iwconfig eth0 key s:password [2]"
.br
.I "	iwconfig eth0 key [2] open"
.br
.I "	iwconfig eth0 key off"
.TP
.BR power
Used to manipulate power management scheme parameters and mode.
.br
To set the period between wake up, enter
.IR "period `value'" .
To set the timeout before going back to sleep, enter
.IR "timeout `value'" .
You can also add the
.IR min " and " max
modifiers. By defaults, those values are in seconds, append the
suffix m or u to specify values un milliseconds or
microseconds. Sometimes, those values are without units (number of
dwell or the like).
.br
.IR off " and " on
disable and reenable power management. Finally, you may set the power
management mode to
.I all
(receive all packets),
.I unicast
(receive unicast packets only, discard multicast and broadcast) and
.I multicast
(receive multicast and broadcast only, discard unicast packets).
.br
.B Examples :
.br
.I "	iwconfig eth0 power period 2"
.br
.I "	iwconfig eth0 power 500m unicast"
.br
.I "	iwconfig eth0 power timeout 300u all"
.br
.I "	iwconfig eth0 power off"
.br
.I "	iwconfig eth0 power min period 2 power max period 4"
.TP
.BR txpower
For cards supporting multiple transmit powers, set the transmit power in dBm. If 
.I W
is the power in Watt, the power in dBm is
.IR "P = 30 + 10.log(W)" .
If the value is postfixed by
.IR mW ,
it will be automatically converted to dBm.
.br
In addition, 
.IR on " and " off
enable and disable the radio, and
.IR auto " and " fixed
enable and disable power control (if those features are available).
.br
.B Examples :
.br
.I "	iwconfig eth0 txpower 15"
.br
.I "	iwconfig eth0 txpower 30mW"
.br
.I "	iwconfig eth0 txpower auto"
.br
.I "	iwconfig eth0 txpower off"
.TP
.BR retry
Most cards have MAC retransmissions, and some allow to set the
behaviour of the retry mechanism.
.br
To set the maximum number of retries, enter
.IR "limit `value'" .
This is an absolute value (without unit).
The set the maximum length of time the MAC should retry, enter
.IR "lifetime `value'" .
By defaults, this value in in seconds, append the suffix m or u to
specify values un milliseconds or microseconds.
.br
You can also add the
.IR min " and " max
modifiers. If the card support automatic mode, they define the bounds
of the limit or lifetime. Some other cards define different values
depending on packet size, for example in 802.11
.I min limit
is the short retry limit (non RTS/CTS packets).
.br
.B Examples :
.br
.I "	iwconfig eth0 retry 16"
.br
.I "	iwconfig eth0 retry lifetime 300m"
.br
.I "	iwconfig eth0 retry min limit 8"
