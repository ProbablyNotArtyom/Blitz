	Wireless Tools
	--------------

	This package contain the Wireless tools, used to manipulate
the Wireless Extensions. The Wireless Extension is an interface
allowing you to set Wireless LAN specific parameters and get the
specific stats.

INSTALL
-------
	This file contains installation instruction and requirements.

PCMCIA.txt
----------
	This file describes how to use Pcmcia init script to configure
Wireless Extensions and how to use Pcmcia schemes.

man pages (iwconfig.8, iwlist.8, iwpriv.8, iwspy.8)
---------
	VERY IMPORTANT : I try to keep the man page up to date, so
you'd better read them before asking questions.
	ALSO IMPORTANT : Those man pages describe the capacity of the
tools, no device implement the full range (and driver usually
implement even less).

	As far as I know, the man pages are the most complete, up to
date and accurate documentation of the wireless tools. An update of
the web page related to Wireless Extension is long overdue. Send
feedback to me.
	The man pages can either be copied in a location where the
command "man" will find them, such as /usr/local/man/man8, or can be
read locally with the command :
		nroff -man xxx.8 | less

iwconfig.c
----------
	The main wireless tool. Used for device configuration and to see
the most common wireless parameters.

iwlist.c
--------
	Display some large chunk of information not displayed by iwconfig.
	For example, all bit rates, all frequencies, all keys...

iwspy.c
-------
	Mobile IP support test and allow get get stats per MAC address
(instead of globally). Also, for some driver/device, this is the only
way to get stats in Ad-Hoc mode.

iwpriv.c
--------
	Manipulate driver private ioctls : all parameters that are
specific to a driver or a device and therefore not part of iwconfig.

iwgetid.c
---------
	Output the ESSID or NWID of the specified device.
	Can also output it in a form that can be used as a Pcmcia Scheme.

Changelog, contributions
------------------------
	See iwcommon.h

wireless.h
----------
	Definition of the Wireless Extensions. You may drop this file
in your kernel headers to update the Wireless Extensions.

Other tools :
-----------
	My web page above list many other tools using Wireless
Extensions that you may find useful...


	The list of changes, credits and errata notes are in
iwcommon.h. Compilation might be tricky, see iwcommon.h for header
problems...
