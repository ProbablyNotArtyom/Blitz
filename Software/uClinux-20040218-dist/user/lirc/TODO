* proper devfs

* make the package portable (you will be able to use LIRC with an
  Irman on Solaris)

* irrecord: fancy Kenwood repeat code 78 11243 78: repeat_tail?

* button_down & button_up codes.

* stupid Pioneer protocol (maybe?)

* internationalization

* IrDA support (SIR support is available, real CIR support is still missing)
