This sub-group of the UCD agent is a 'mature beta' implementation of
the AgentX agent extensibility protocol, as described in RFC 2741.

  This is a reasonably full implementation, in as much as it 
supports all the protocol operations described in this document.
The core functionality has received a reasonable amount of exposure,
and is believed to be more or less stable in normal use.   It will
now also handle the non-graceful termination of subagents - returning
a 'genErr' error for three successive requests before unregistering
the unresponsive subagent.

  Note that the reverse is not true, and a subagent will not
re-establish contact with a dead and resurrected master in the default
configuration.  Putting the following line in your
APPLICATION.conf file:
  agentxPingInterval 60
will make the subagent try to ping the master every 60 seconds, and if
the connection is deemed broken it'll try and reconnect to the master
agent after that point (once every 60 seconds).

  Similarly, a subagent will not be able to re-register in place of a
defunct colleague until the master agent has received three requests
for the dead connection (and hence unregistered it).

  Some of the less frequently used features (index allocation,
range registration, etc), have received less thorough testing,
and may well not be fully functional.   Many of the omissions
of the earlier release (Contexts, use of GetBulk, the AgentX MIB)
are still missing from this version.

While the implementation is not yet suitable for mission-critical
production systems, it should prove sufficiently reliable for
general-purpose use.


  AgentX support is now included in the agent by default, but needs
to be explicitly enabled before use.  (This *is* still beta code
after all).  Activate this using by putting a line

		master	agentx

in the snmpd.conf file.  This support is also enabled automatically
when the '-x' flag is given (to specify a different master AgentX socket),
or when the agent is invoked as an AgentX subagent (i.e. via the name
'agentxd' or with the '-X' flag).

  See the main project web page for an examples of a simple stand-alone
subagent.  (http://www.net-snmp.org/tutorial-5/toolkit/)
