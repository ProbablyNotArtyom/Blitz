TODO list for the ucd-snmp-coders:

  create our own source rpm spec file, independent from RedHat
  possibly add WinSNMP wrappers around the ucd-snmp functions
  Continue to add and improve manual pages/documentation.
  More snmpset'able variables.
  Should be able to set the fix script line in the .conf files per type.
  Implement IP routing table manipulation using sysctl() on systems that
    support the route socket (BSD 4.4 and IRIX >= 6.2)
  Implement new IP forwarding table MIB (RFC 2096), at least on systems
    that have classless routing tables internally
  Implement IP/UDP/TCP statistics on IRIX 6.2 and later using
    sysmp(MP_SAGET,MPSA_TCPIPSTAT,...) and <sys/tcpipstats.h>
  Follow the evolution of the Interfaces Group MIB
    (draft-ietf-ifmib-mib-05.txt) and implement what can be
    implemented.
  Make read_objid and sprint_objid agree on which shorthands they accept.
  snmpset should check against MIB size if possible?
  Remove unsuppored mib nodes from output instead of returning '0's.
  Support for Counter64 in snmpdelta
  API for traps that pass scripts can use.
  Make memory/swap variables UInts instead of Ints.

Issues:

	CODE-RELATED ISSUES
	-------------------

Architecture-specific implementations:
	How to handle differences between architectures
	   - overall common template
	   - "standard" implementation (with minor differences)
	   - architecture unique implementations
	pre-processor #ifdefs or separate files

Function argument handling:
	Function declaration prototypes
	Function definition prototypes
	How to handle both ANSI and K&R compilers

Threading
	Single thread / multi-thread / event driven / asynchronous

Lookup design
	Kernel digging vs "clean" interfaces (sysctl/ioctl)

Error Handling
	Ensure all return values are checked for validity

Documented APIs

WinSNMP interface

Package name
	UCD-snmp vs Net-snmp



	FUNCTIONALITY-RELATED ISSUES
	----------------------------

Per-interface information
	(speed/type/counters/non-ethernet address)

Multi-CPU support

Real Time O/S support

64-bit counters

Non-ethernet interface support
	Address handling code tends to assume 6 octet
	physical addresses and 4 octet transport addresses

Non-fully-qualified name output
	(Probably covered now?)

Formatted dump
	unpick the ASN encoding, rather than
	simply dumping the bare data

Module interdependence



	EXTENSIBILITY-RELATED ISSUES
	----------------------------

AgentX

SMUX

Dynamic loading of modules

"Intelligent" Agent
	agent-initiated traps
	threshold monitoring

PHP scripting

Extensible trapd



	PERFORMANCE-RELATED ISSUES
	--------------------------

Memory Leaks

Information caching
	(e.g. Host Resources information)

Intelligent table handling
	(i.e. not resetting internal state for each request)

Pre-compiled MIBs
	to speed up MIB parsing

Duplicate requests
	Currently these are processed afresh each time.
	They should probably be either dropped or use cached replies

Security
	Go through the library and apps and check all arrays and
	buffers for overruns. There are a lot of unchecked ones.

===================

Other Ideas:
  Make the mib parser figure out which of the above files it needs to
    load rather than loading them all -- Tom Georges & Joe Marzot

can avoid multiple people working on the same thing)
