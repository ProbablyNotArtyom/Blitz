*5.0.4*

   During the testing for release 5.0.4, a release candidate was uploaded
   to Sourceforge and marked as hidden. For variouse reasons, the release
   was delayed and further changes and fixes were made.  However, the 
   release candidate files still appeared on the public FTP server and our
   mirrors. To avoid the confusion that could occur to users who may have
   downloaded this release candidate, we are bumping the revision number
   to 5.0.5.  If you downloaded net-snmp-5.0.4.tar.gz, please upgrade
   to net-snmp-5.0.5.tar.gz.

    - various documentation clean ups.
    - 64 bit address clean ups.
    - misc other bug fixes.

*5.0*

 New:

    - Much of the agent internals were completely rewritten and sports
      a new module API to make your life easier.  See the
      agent/mibgroup/examples directory for example code that makes
      use of some of the new functionality.
      (Also see http://www.net-snmp.org/tutorial-5/agent/ which has
      some incomplete documentation)
    - The agent sports embedded perl, see the perl details further below.
    - The agent supports multiple SNMPv3 contexts and mib modules can
      now register themselves under different contexts.  (see the -n
      option in the snmpcmd manual page for details on specifying
      context strings in requests)
    - The proxy code has been completely rewritten and now supports
      the use of SNMPv3 contexts to help select which proxied host you
      wish to talk to.  See the snmpd.conf manual page.
    - All the tools take --configToken=value options now.  (see -H
      output from any command for what configTokens it accepts)
    - All the tools can speak over many different transport layers
      now, including UDP/TCP (ipv4 and ipv6), AAL5pvc, and IPX.  See
      ./configure --help for details on enabling them.
      Note: the -p and -T flags to all the applications have been
      removed.  Use hostname strings like "tcp:localhost:9999"
      instead.  See the snmpcmd manual page for details.
    - snmptrapd now acts as an agentx subagent and implements portions
      of the NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB to allow captured traps and informs
      to be queried.
    - A "net-snmp-config" script will get installed which can report
      how the various tools were built (which libraries they were
      linked against, etc).  It will also help you do other things as
      well, like setting up snmpv3.  Run net-snmp-config --help for details.
    - kerberos authenticated and encrypted SNMPv3 is now possible.
      See ./configure --help for details on enabling the ksm security module.
    - The AgentX subagent protocol implementation has many new
      features and fixes.
    - mib2c was completely rewritten and has a much improved
      configuration file specification.
    - Much of the code is getting documented with "doxygen" style
      documentation.  Run "make docs" if you have doxygen installed.
    - some RMON support is available.
      (See agent/mibgroup/Rmon/README for details.)
    - The source tree has been reorganized and all the exported header
      files are now in the include subdirectory.  You can now point to
      the includes easily without having to run "make install" first.
    - the agent now requires a configuration file to access any information.
    - The entire code base has had indent run on it to effect a
      consistent coding style.  See the CodingStyle file for details.

 Perl:
    
    - The SNMP perl module now calls init_snmp() like real net-snmp
      applications, which means it will read snmp.conf configuration
      files, etc.
    - new perl specific configure options --with-perl-modules &
      --enable-embedded-perl.  See ./configure --help for details.
    - The beginnings of some new Perl modules (alpha level quality)
      are in the perl directory, including:
      - NetSNMP::agent which allows perl scripts to become net-snmp
        master or subagents
      - AnyData::SNMP is available that implements a perl DBI
        interface to map SQL commands to SNMP.  Included is a "netsh"
        shell where SQL commands can be typed, aliases created, etc.
        See the perl/AnyData_SNMP/INSTALL file for details.
    - Beginning (alpha level quality) support for embedding perl
      subroutines directly within the net-snmp agent.

      programs and scripts when a trap has been received.
      (see snmptrapd.conf(5))
    - More configuration files have been created and can be used to
      specify defaults and configuration information to the various
      applications.  Run each command with -H to see what it understands.
      (see snmp_config(5), snmpd.conf(5), snmp.conf(5), snmptrapd.conf(5))

    - The mib parser supports a variety of options dictating how
      strictly it parses mib files.
      (see snmpcmd.1 on "-P")

 Copyright:
    - Simplification.

*3.5*

 New:
    - agent/mibgroup directory reorganized hierarchically.
      - this may break the agent compilation with some compilers.
    - floats, doubles, counter64s, int64s, uint64s support via opaque types.

 Important:
    - the UCD-SNMP specific mib structure changed.
      - many of the table oids have changed location and have been renamed.
    - the View Based Access Control module was implemented in the agent.
      Therefore, the "community" snmpd.conf parameter no longer
      exists.  See the snmpd.conf file for how to control access via
      community names now.
    - The header file #defines have changed.  You may have to compile
      third party applications with -DCMU_COMPATIBLE (like perl-SNMP <= V1.7).
    - The parser is more strict about unlinked OIDs and end-of-comment
      conditions.  You may see problems in a few broken mibs that used
      to parse ok with the older parser.

      /usr/local/sbin (set differently using --sbindir).

  New:
    - basic SNMPV2c support.  
      - Not fully tested (feedback please!), and not RFC compliant.
      - all apps require '-v 2c' for v2c and '-v 2p' for the older party code.

      - new man page: mib_api.3
    - The agent has been completely restructured (modularized) to
      allow for easier extension via C code and requires no
      modification of the ucd-snmp distributed source code to add in
      new C coded mib modules.  See the README file in the
      agent/mibgroup subdirectory for details.  Modules are added and/or
      removed via configure options.

    - snmp_open calls getservbyname only once now, at the request of Gary
      Hayward <gah@dirac.bellcore.com>.  Mainly for Perl users.
