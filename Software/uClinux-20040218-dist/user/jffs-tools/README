The quick start guide to jffs :-)
---------------------------------

1.	Make sure you change linuc/drivers/block/flash.c to know where your
	flash chip sits in memory.  Currently it is setup to point to the
	second 2Mb chip on a NETtel.  Look in flash_probe() for the chip start
	addresses.

	Do not point this at flash that contains code and other bits as
	it will try to write over it.

2.	Add this directory to the user/Makefile and erase to the romfs.mk
	Edit the romfs_cvs.mk and make sure that the "flash-devices" get
	included in the "make romfs".  Rebuild the romfs after making changes
	to this file.

3.	Erase the partition you want to use,  for example:

		erase /dev/flash1

4.	Mount the newly erased partition,  you will need the full blown mount.

		mount -t jffs /dev/flash1 /mnt

5.	Copy and remove your files at will :-)


Building jffs filesystems
-------------------------

1.	Go into the mkfs.jffs directory.

2.	Check the swap/endianess of the target system v. that of the system
	you are building the jffs on.  Change SWAP_XXXX macros to suit.  If the
	endianess is the same then use the NOP versions.

3.	Create a directory containing the filesystem layout you want
	(ie., jffs-dir).

4.	Create the fs image with:

		mkfs.jffs -d jffs-dir > jffs.image

	You can pad this image with 0xff and include it in a full system image
	or just "dd" it into the flash as follows (remember to use the
	character device):

		dd if=jffs.image of=/dev/flashc1

	The image must be padded with 0xff as the jffs/flash driver needs to be
	able to write to the unused areas.
