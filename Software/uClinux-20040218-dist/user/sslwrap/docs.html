<h1>sslwrap</h1>

<p>sslwrap is a simple Unix service that sits over any simple TCP service such as POP3,
IMAP, SMTP, and encrypts all of the data on the connection using TLS/SSL. It uses <a
href="http://www.psy.uq.edu.au:8080/~ftp/Crypto">ssleay</a> to support SSL version 2 and
3. It can run out of inetd. It can also encrypt data for services located on another
computer.</p>

<p>It works with the servers you already have, and does not require any modifications to
your existing servers.</p>

<h2><a name="Installation">Installation</a></h2>

<p>Just follow these steps to build sslwrap.&nbsp; </p>

<h3>Make ssleay</h3>

<p>You will need to get and build OpenSSL or ssleay. OpenSSL is available from <a
href="http://www.openssl.org">www.openssl.org</a>. The <a
href="http://www.psy.uq.edu.au:8080/~ftp/Crypto/#Where to get {{SSLeay}} - FTP site list">ssleay
FAQ</a> lists the current mirror locations for ssleay. Just follow the instructions to
build it. sslwrap assumes that the libraries will be in /usr/local/ssl/lib and the
includes in /usr/local/ssl/include. These are the default locations for the Makefiles
included with ssleay.</p>

<p>Note that in the U.S. it appears that you must link with RSAREF from <a
href="http://www.rsa.com">RSA Data Security, Inc</a>. instead of using the ssleay public
key algorithms. This is described in the ssleay documentation. There may be additional use
restrictions imposed by the RSAREF license.</p>

<p>sslwrap was tested with ssleay 0.8.1 and 0.9.0b and OpenSSL 0.9.3b, and OpenSSL 0.9.4.</p>

<h3>Make sslwrap</h3>

<p>You can get sslwrap source as a tar/gzip file via HTTP here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rickk.com/sslwrap/sslwrap.tar.gz">http://www.rickk.com/sslwrap/sslwrap.tar.gz</a></p>

<p>The file is approximately 20K. </p>

<p>Then unzip and untar the files:</p>

<pre>gunzip sslwrap.tar.gz
tar xf sslwrap.tar</pre>

<p>Just do a &quot;make&quot; and (hopefully) the file &quot;sslwrap&quot; will be
created. The Makefile assumes gcc; you will need to edit it for other compilers and
options. There isn't much in there, though.</p>

<p>If you are using ssleay instead of OpenSSL comment out the first OPENSSL= line and
uncomment out the second one in Makefile.</p>

<p>If you are using Solaris you will probably need to remove the &quot;#&quot; from the
beginning of the line that reads &quot;EXTLIBS = -lxnet&quot; in the Makefile.</p>

<p>I copied the built version of sslwrap to /usr/local/sbin, but you may prefer a
different location. It doesn't matter where is is, as long as your inetd.conf file points
to the location you put the file.</p>

<h3>Get a certificate</h3>

<p>You need a certificate for your server. You can make a self-signed certificate with no
encryption by using these commands from the ssleay FAQ:</p>

<pre>cd /usr/local/ssl/certs
/usr/local/ssl/bin/req -new -x509 -nodes -out server.pem -keyout server.pem -days 365
ln -s server.pem `/usr/local/ssl/bin/x509 -noout -hash &lt; server.pem`.0</pre>

<p>There is information on getting a real server certificate from a Certificate Authority
(CA) in the ssleay FAQ. Note that <a href="http://www.verisign.com">Verisign</a>
previously would not issue a certificate for a server using ssleay; though this may have
changed.</p>

<p>There is a security problem with sslwrap: it requires an unencrypted private key. Since
sslwrap runs out of inetd it is not particularly convenient to prompt the server operator
for the private key password. I'm only using sslwrap for the link encryption (not server
identity verification), so I'm using a self-signed certificate, and I'm not as concerned
about the private key being stolen. </p>

<p>You can use self-signed certificates using Netscape Navigator 2.0 or later, or
Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.02 or later. The client will need to go through several
dialogs to add the certificate, either for the session or until expiration.</p>

<p>You will want to chmod 600 your certificate file so that normal users won't be able to
read your unencrypted private key.</p>

<p>Also, when req prompts for you &quot;Common Name (eg, YOUR name) []&quot; enter your
host name, not your name, for a server certificate. Netscape 3.0.2 and later allow
wildcards (i.e. &quot;*.acme.com&quot;) but Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 does not. The
hostname can be an IP CNAME, but must match whatever you specified to connect to (in the
https URL, mail configuration, etc.) or you will get a warning dialog in the client.</p>

<p>You can also use sslwrap without a certificate; to do this use the -nocert option in
the command line for either inetd or daemon mode.</p>

<h3>Add to /etc/services</h3>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.iana.org/numbers.html">IANA</a>, the following port
numbers have been assigned for SSL:</p>

<pre>https 443/tcp     # http protocol over TLS/SSL
smtps 465/tcp     # smtp protocol over TLS/SSL
nntps 563/tcp     # nttp protocol over TLS/SSL
telnets 992/tcp   # telnet protocol over TLS/SSL
imaps 993/tcp     # imap4 protocol over TLS/SSL
ircs 994/tcp      # irc protocol over TLS/SSL
pop3s 995/tcp     # POP3 protocol over TLS/SSL
ftps-data 989/tcp # ftp protocol, data, over TLS/SSL
ftps 990/tcp      # ftp protocol, control, over TLS/SSL</pre>

<p>If you do not have the entries above in /etc/services, you will probably want to add
them.</p>

<p>Note that you cannot front-end ftp data connections with sslwrap nor can you front-end
UDP services. While you can front-end telnet using sslwrap, only the &quot;sslonly&quot;
variant of telnet is supported. Other SSL telnet implementations such as <a
href="ftp://ftp.uni-mainz.de/pub/internet/security/ssl/SSL-MZapps">SSL-MZtelnet</a> also
support SSL via telnet option negotiation to the standard telnet port (23) instead of
using the special port (992). </p>

<p>While you can front-end your HTTP server with sslwrap, you're better off using <a
href="http://www.apache-ssl.org">apache-ssl</a>. It is more efficient and won't adversely
affect your logs. If you use sslwrap, all connections appear to come from
&quot;localhost&quot;. The <a href="http://stronghold.ukweb.com/">Stronghold</a> version
of Apache also comes with a <a href="http://www.thawte.com/">Thawte</a> certificate. Using
a self-signed certificate for electronic commerce is probably not a good idea. </p>

<p>You cannot front-end SMTP service with Netscape Communicator 4.5 and later clients. Due
to a change in port assignments by IANA, there is no longer a smtps service port (465),
and there won't ever be one assigned. Instead, smtps can only be negotiated on the
standard SMTP port (25), and therefore cannot easily be wrapped.</p>

<h3>Running out of inetd</h3>

<p>If you want to run sslwrap out of inetd, you will need to edit inetd.conf to add all of
the services you want to front-end:</p>

<pre>https stream tcp nowait sslwrap /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/local/sbin/sslwrap
-cert /usr/local/ssl/certs/server.pem -port 80

imaps stream tcp nowait sslwrap /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/local/sbin/sslwrap
-cert /usr/local/ssl/certs/server.pem -port 143

telnets stream tcp nowait sslwrap /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/local/sbin/sslwrap
-cert /usr/local/ssl/certs/server.pem -port 23

pop3s stream tcp nowait sslwrap /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/local/sbin/sslwrap
-cert /usr/local/ssl/certs/server.pem -port 110 </pre>

<p>This example is from Linux; your inetd.conf file may vary. </p>

<p>The service (https, imaps, telnets, pop3s, etc.) is the service identifier you added to
/etc/services.</p>

<p>I created a user which has no login privileges and is pretty much like
&quot;nobody&quot; called &quot;sslwrap&quot; to run sslwrap. Note that sslwrap has not
been analyzed extensively and it is not recommended that you run it setuid root, nor does
it need to be. But you do need to make sure it can read the private certificate file. </p>

<p>The -cert parameter specifies the certificate file which may be the self-signed
certificate you created above, or a real certificate. The certificate file's private key
must not be encrypted.</p>

<p>The -port parameter specifies the port to connect to. When a connection comes in via
SSL, a connection is made to localhost and this port. This is the port that the actual
service is listening on.</p>

<p>The -addr parameter specifies the address to connect to. In the absence of the -addr
parameter a connection is made to localhost. The parameter must be an IP address in dotted
decimal notation, such as 123.45.67.89. </p>

<p>You will need to restart inetd, typically by using kill -HUP <em>&lt;pid of inetd&gt;</em>.</p>

<h3>Running as a daemon</h3>

<p>You can also run sslwrap as a daemon instead of running out of inetd. </p>

<pre>/usr/local/sbin/sslwrap -cert /usr/local/ssl/certs/server.pem \
-port 80 -accept 443 &amp;

/usr/local/sbin/sslwrap -cert /usr/local/ssl/certs/server.pem \
-port 143 -accept 993 &amp;

/usr/local/sbin/sslwrap -cert /usr/local/ssl/certs/server.pem \
-port 23 -accept 992 &amp;

/usr/local/sbin/sslwrap -cert /usr/local/ssl/certs/server.pem \
-port 110 -accept 995 &amp;</pre>

<p>You might type in commands like this, or perhaps add it to one of the startup files,
like rc.inet2.</p>

<p>I created a user which has no login privileges and is pretty much like
&quot;nobody&quot; called &quot;sslwrap&quot; to run sslwrap for inetd. This works fine
for inetd, but the problem is that you must be root to bind to a 'reserved port' (less
than 1024) under Unix. This would require running sslwrap setuid root. Since sslwrap has
not been analyzed to be sure it's safe to run setuid root, I really have to warn against
doing this. You really should use inetd instead of daemon mode. </p>

<p>The -cert parameter specifies the certificate file which may be the self-signed
certificate you created above, or a real certificate. The certificate file's private key
must not be encrypted.</p>

<p>The -port parameter specifies the port to connect to. When a connection comes in via
SSL, a connection is made to localhost and this port. This is the port that the actual
service is listening on.</p>

<p>The -addr parameter specifies the address to connect to. In the absence of the -addr
parameter a connection is made to localhost. The parameter must be an IP address in dotted
decimal notation, such as 123.45.67.89. </p>

<p>The -accept parameter specifies the port to listen on (that is, accept connection on).
This is the SSL port number.</p>

<h3>Connecting To Another Machine</h3>

<p>You can &quot;ssl-ize&quot; a service running on a computer other than the one you're
running sslwrap on. Of course anyone between you and the server your connecting on can
still look at your clear text data, but if you'll be connecting to the SSL server from an
even more distant or insecure area, you may still have benefits from doing this.</p>

<p>Remote connection can be done from inetd or as a daemon; add a &quot;-addr&quot;
parameter to the command line:</p>

<pre>imaps stream tcp nowait sslwrap /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/local/sbin/sslwrap
-cert /usr/local/ssl/certs/server.pem -port 143 -addr 123.45.67.89</pre>

<p>The address must be specified in dotted decimal notation and be an IP address, not a
hostname.</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>sslwrap has only been lightly tested by me. It works for what I wanted it for (SSL IMAP
with Microsoft Outlook 98, though previously I used Netscape Communicator), and I do not
guarantee it will work for you. It has been tested in the following environment:</p>

<p>My server is running RedHat Linux 6.0 on the x86 platform. I have front-ended <a
href="http://www.imap.org">IMAP</a> (University of Washington server), POP3 (Qualcomm <a
href="http://www.eudora.com/freeware/servers.html">qpopper</a>), <a
href="http://www.apache.org">Apache</a> HTTP server, telnet (MIT ktelnetd), and SMTP
(sendmail) successfully.</p>

<p>I have tested the server using <a href="http://www.netscape.com">Netscape</a>
Communicator 4.01a for both HTTP and IMAP under Windows 95 and Windows NT; it works quite
well. Note, however, that Netscape Communicator 4.5 cannot use SSL SMTP. This is because
Netscape removed all of the functionality for SMTP on port 465 in versions 4.5 and later.</p>

<p>I have tested it with https using <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>
Internet Explorer 4.0.1 under Windows 95. <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/outlook/">Microsoft
Outlook</a> 98 Beta 2 under Windows NT also was able to use SSL POP3 successfully, as
well. Note that you must use a version of Internet Explorer later than 3.02 when you're
using a self-signed certificate because older versions do not allow certificates made by
certificate authority that is not on the list of approved CAs. Unfortunately, you cannot
remember an unknown CA like you can with Netscape, so you are frequently prompted to allow
the unknown CA. A real server certificate would probably work fine, but this is not
necessarily recommended because of the requirement for an unencrypted private key. </p>

<p>A later test, done March 19, 1998, on a different computer, yielded somewhat different
results with Microsoft Outlook 98 Beta 2 under Windows NT 4.0 (Service Pack 3). In this
case, I was able to use my self-signed server certificate for both IMAP and SMTP without
warning. I cannot explain why this would be the case, but I am both happy (that I don't
get a dialog every time I connect) and sad (that I wasn't warned about an unknown CA)!</p>

<p>I have since switched to using Microsoft Outlook 98 and it seems to work quite well for
SSL IMAP and SSL SMTP. In fact, it works a little better than Netscape Communication
because it breaks the connection less often. If your sslwrap server is not really fast,
generating the temporary keys at the beginning of each connection can take several
seconds. </p>

<p>Aside from not being recommended for security reasons, running sslwrap in daemon mode
has not been tested very much. I really suggest using inetd mode instead of daemon mode.</p>
