+ cut out dhcp server checking.. this was causing dialout ppp
	sessions with idle time set to never time out.

	was originally to stop it replying to a dhcp client
	on a NETtel which was really a bad way to do it in the
	first place :-)

+ fixes for route add -host on a machine that needs to run both
	a DHCP client and server (dual eth box)

0.8.18 (991220)

+ Race conditions fixed by disabling alarm whilst the server is busy

+ Non blocking error is changes to informational as it is not really
  an error

	client bug)
+ removed re_offered variable as it breaks multiple client support
+ added lease time to ACK -- doesn't work if in OFFER
+ decreased internal array clear delay to 60 seconds
