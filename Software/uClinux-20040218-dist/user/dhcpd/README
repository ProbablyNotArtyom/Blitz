NETtel DHCP Server README
-------------------------

The NETtel DHCP Server is designed to run on a NETtel (which
runs on Greg Ungerer's uClinux-coldfire kernel) but will easily
run on normal Linux distributions for PCs.

The NETtel DHCP Server is designed deliberately to be a small,
lean, DHCP server. It does not implement the entire protocol
but only what is necessary to serve the following:

	IP address (and its subnet)
	Gateway address
	DNS Server address
	WINS (NetBIOS Name Server) 

The lease times are hard coded to 10 days (from memory :-)


The NETtel DHCP Server employs a number of simple config files:

dhcpd.iplist
------------
Binary list of ip addresses that the server may offer. This list may
include ip addresses already leased out.


dhcpd.leased
------------
Binary list of leased ip addresses and their respective MAC address.
format:

16 byte MAC
8 byte ip address
16 byte MAC
8 byte ip address
.
etc.

example: hexdump dhcpd.leases

   0: 00 AB 00 00 00 00 00 00-00 FF 00 00 00 00 00 01 ................
  10: CB 18 97 78 00 BB 00 00-00 00 00 00 00 AA 00 00 ...x............
  20: 00 00 00 CC CB 18 97 79-00 80 5F 94 28 2A 00 00 .......y.._.(*..
  30: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00-CB 18 97 7A             ...........z    

dhcpd.conf
----------

/etc/config> cat dhcpd.conf
subnet 255.255.255.0
router 203.24.151.121
wins 203.50.0.24
/etc/config> 


---
DNS is grabbed from resolv.conf:
nameserver x.x.x.x
nameserver y.y.y.y
nameserver z.z.z.z

Up to 3 DNS servers are supported.

Q&A


Q. Isn't this all very complicated for a lease/ip pool?
A. yes.. but it saves space :-)
