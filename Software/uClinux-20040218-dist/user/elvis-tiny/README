Elvis is a clone of vi/ex, the standard UNIX editor.  Elvis supports nearly
all of the vi/ex commands, in both visual mode and colon mode.

Elvis runs under BSD UNIX, AT&T SysV UNIX, SCO Xenix, Minix, MS-DOS, Atari TOS,
OS9/68000, and Coherent.  Ports to other operating systems are in progress;
contact me before you start porting it to some other OS, because somebody else
may have already done it for you.

Elvis is freely redistributable, in either source form or executable form.
There are no restrictions on how you may use it.

The documentation will reside in a subdirectory called "doc".  On some systems,
you may need to create this directory before you can extract the documentation.
The "doc/*.man" files are UNIX-style man pages; they are meant to be processed
by "nroff -man".  The "doc/*.doc" files are all chapters of the manual.  They
have already been formatted, and they contain Epson-compatible escape sequences
to control type styles.  A program called "refont" is included for stripping
these out, if necessary.

The file named "Makefile.mix" is used for all systems except MS-DOS.  You
should copy "Makefile.mix" to "Makefile", and then edit "Makefile" to select
the appropriate group of settings for your system.
