	Integrated a collection of patches that had been lurking on the net,
	  including the 256-ptys support for telnetd and passive mode ftp.
	Major security fixes, including to fingerd, lpr, rlogin, rsh, talkd, 
	  and telnetd. Do *not* use the sliplogin from earlier versions of this
	  package, either.
	Much of the code builds without libbsd.a or bsd includes.
	Massive code cleanup. Almost everything compiles clean with gcc
	  -Wall now. rusers and rusersd do not; patches to rpcgen to fix
	  this would be appreciated if anyone feels like it.
