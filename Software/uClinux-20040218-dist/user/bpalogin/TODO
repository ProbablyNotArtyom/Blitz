! #bug 1:
	bpalogin crashes after it tries to re-establish a connection
	that is no longer reachable (on uClinux-coldfire ports -- unconfirmed
	on other architectures)

+ autoconf/automake this beastie
+ support for other cable modem services providers  (such as those in the US)
	(@Home in the US uses dhcpcd -h xxx and hence has no need for a
	login client)
