  SMTPclient -- simple SMTP client

  This program is a minimal SMTP client that takes an email
  message body and passes it on to a SMTP server (default is the
  MTA on the local host). Since it is completely self-supporting,
  it is especially suitable for use in restricted environments.

  Version 1.0.0 (22-10-1997)
