mp3play README
--------------

Application for playing MP3 data on embedded systems. mp3play is
designed to be able to play mp3 data files within the local filesystem
(which can be a network filesystem), or fetch files to play via http
over a network. For the http case the address can specify a streaming
MP3 server.

Simple usage is:

    mp3play file.mp3

Specify as many files as you want and mp3play will play each in turn.
To play data over http use something like:

    mp3play http://a.b.c.d/file.mp3

Or for a streaming source something like:

    mp3play http://a.b.c.d:20000

mp3play expects a raw DAC style output device (PCM output). Most sound 
boards have one, for some embedded environments this is all they have.
The default is the ColdFire based dac0800 driver. Others may take a
little code to support cleanly...

See README.lib for info on the mpegdec_lib library.
