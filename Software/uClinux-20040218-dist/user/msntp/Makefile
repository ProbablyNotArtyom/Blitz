# Makefile for msntp
# N.M. Maclaren, October 2000.

# Take a look at README for the various preprocessor symbols, but they are
# extremely unlikely to be needed on newer systems.  You may prefer to change
# LOCKNAME and SAVENAME to use /var/run (or even /tmp) rather than /etc.  Note
# that not all of the following system settings have been tested recently.

# These options will work on most modern systems.  Start with them, and add
# any necessary options.
# CC = cc
# CFLAGS = -O
# LDFLAGS =
# LIBS = -lm

# Compiling this sort of ANSI C under SunOS 4.1 is a mug's game, because Sun's
# Unix headers make GNU C vomit even in compatibility mode, but the following
# will compile main.c and unix.c.  At least two people have got it to work.
# CC = gcc -ansi
# CFLAGS = -O -DNONBLOCK_BROKEN
# LDFLAGS =
# LIBS = -lm

# The following settings can be used under SOME versions of Solaris 2, but
# -D_XOPEN_SOURCE should probably be added on versions where setting that
# does not cause it to reject its own headers!  They can also be used under
# UnixWare, probably with similar constraints.
# CC = cc -Xc
# CFLAGS = -O -v
# LDFLAGS =
# LIBS = -lm -lsocket -lnsl

# The following settings can be used under HP-UX 10.0 and later on PA-RISC and
# HP-UX 9.03 and later on 68000.
# CC = cc -Aa -D_HPUX_SOURCE
# CFLAGS = -O
# LDFLAGS =
# LIBS = -lm

# The following settings can be used under HP-UX before 10.0 on PA-RISC.
# CC = cc -Aa -D_HPUX_SOURCE
# CFLAGS = -O -DADJTIME_MISSING
# LDFLAGS =
# LIBS = -lm

# The following settings can be used under Digital Unix (aka DEC OSF/1).
# CC = cc -std1
# CFLAGS = -O
# LDFLAGS =

# The following settings can be used under DEC Ultrix 4.3 on a MIPS.
# CC = gcc -ansi
# CFLAGS = -O -DNONBLOCK_BROKEN

# The following settings can be used under SGI Irix.
# CC = cc -ansi

# CC = cc -Aa -D_HIUX_SOURCE

# CC = cc
# CFLAGS = -O
# LDFLAGS =

# The following settings can be used under at least NextStep 3.  cc is a
# wrapper for gcc.
# CC = cc -D_POSIX_SOURCE
# CFLAGS = -O
# LDFLAGS =
# LIBS = -lm

# The following settings can be used under Unicos.
# CC = cc -DNONBLOCK_BROKEN
# CFLAGS = -O
# LDFLAGS = 
# LIBS = -lm

# The following settings can be used under Linux.  While adjtime is present,
# it is completely broken (i.e. it will work only if xntp is running), so it
# is a good idea to add -DADJTIME_MISSING.
# CC = cc -DADJTIME_MISSING
# CFLAGS = -O
# LDFLAGS = 
# LIBS = -lm

# It has been compiled with the following options, though with quite a lot of
# warnings (many due to system header bugs!)  All functions defined without a
# previous declaration should be internal to that file - static is not used
# because it often interferes with debugging.
# CC = gcc -ansi
# CFLAGS = -O -pedantic -Wall -Wtraditional -Wshadow -Wpointer-arith \
# -Wcast-qual -Wcast-align -Wwrite-strings -Wconversion -Waggregate-return \
