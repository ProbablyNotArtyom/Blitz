              WHATS NEW IN Samba 2.0.7
              ========================

This is the latest stable release of Samba. This is the
version that all production Samba servers should be running
for all current bug-fixes.

New Documentation in 2.0.7
--------------------------

O'Reilly and Associates have donated their book "Using Samba"
to the Samba community to be updated in a collaberative way
along with the Samba software. Starting with this release the
html of "Using Samba" will be distributed with the Samba software
as the online documentation for Samba. Bug fixes for the book
are encouraged as is new material. Please help us make this
documentation the best it can be for Samba !

SWAT (Samba Web Administration Tool) has been updated to
add a link to the full text of "Using Samba" from the start
screen.

Note that this does not mean that the other documentation
(man pages especially) are being abandoned. The Samba Team
is still committed to updating and improving *all* the 
documentation shipped with Samba.

Also, as the source code for the book is moved into a more
manageable format (not raw HTML) we are committed to making
it available for editing by all interested parties. The
current situation of only shipping HTML with the Samba software
is a first attempt at getting this documentation integrated
with the Samba software and should not be regarded as the only
way in which this material will be made available (it was just
the quickest way to get the book integrated into 2.0.7 :-).

Windows 2000 Issues
-------------------

This version of Samba has been tested with Windows 2000 and
the five known incompatibilities with Windows 2000 have been
fixed. See the "Changes in 2.0.7" list below for details.

New/Changed parameters in 2.0.7
-------------------------------

There is a new option to the autoconf "./configure" script.
This is the "--with-utmp" (and attendant "--without-utmp")
option. Running configure with this option will cause smbd
to attempt to use utmp accounting for users who log on and
log off to the Samba server.

There are 5 new parameters in the smb.conf file.

utmp
utmp dir
utmp hostname
utmp consolidate
wtmp directory

These parameters are only available if the "--with-utmp"
option was selected at configure time. The yes/no option "utmp"
specifies whether utmp records should be recorded on user
logon/logoff. It defaults to "no". The "utmp dir" and "wtmp dir"
are string parameters specifying pathnames to the directories containing
the utmp/wtmp file databases. See the smb.conf man page for more details.

inherit permissions

This boolean parameter causes newly created files and directories
to inherit their initial permissions from their parent directory.
This can be very useful in propagating such things as the set-group
bit in directory heirarchies. See the smb.conf man page for more
details.

write cache size

This integer parameter specifies (in bytes) the size of a user level
per-file write cache that smbd will create for an oplocked file. This
can improve performance significantly for writing files by causing
writes to be done in large chunk sizes. If this parameter is set (it
defaults to zero which means no write cache) to the stripe size of
a raid volume then it will cause writes to be much more efficient.
Up to 10 write caches can be active simultaneously per smbd (allocated
for the first 10 oplocked file opens). All normal warnings about the
dangers of user level caching of data apply. See the smb.conf man page
for more details.

source environment 

This pathname parameter causes Samba to read a list of environment
variables from a named file on startup. This can be useful in setting
up Samba in a clustered environment. See the smb.conf man page for more
details.

Ability to delete users added
-----------------------------

SWAT and smbpasswd can now delete users from the Samba smbpasswd file.
See the man page for smbpasswd for details.

Roving profile behavior finalized
---------------------------------

The change in behavior with roving profiles (using the "logon home"
parameter instead of the "logon path" parameter) introduced in 2.0.6
has been discovered to be consistant with the way Windows NT behaves,
and has been left as the default action. Please see the additional
notes in the "logon home" parameter description in the smb.conf man
page for more details.

Changes in 2.0.7
-----------------

1). Fix for the semaphore promblems when compiling Samba with gcc on
SGI IRIX 6.5.x.
2). Quota support for Veritas filesystem added by David Lee.
3). Incoming RPC code re-written to support multiple PDU input from
the client. This should make the RPC subsystem more robust.
4). Fix from Ying Chen @ IBM to inline many frequently called functions. This
decreased CPU usage by 10%.
5). Fix from Ying Chen @ IBM to use a hash table to lookup entries in the file
cache. This is a significant improvement over the old linked-list
lookup code.
6). smbclient issues with native language support fixed. smbclient
now uses UNIX filename character sets exclusively when communicating
with libsmb library.
7). smbclient fix to not print error messages when "putting" an
empty file.
8). smbclient fix to cope with spaces in filenames when recursing.
9). Improved error reporting in smbclient when getting browse lists.
10). NetBIOS "scope" now supported in all Samba code/tools.
11). New mapping from code page 850 to UNIX "roman8" character set.
12). Fix for crash bug if debug file handle couldn't be opened.
13). Fix to allow mkdir to correctly set the high order permissions 
bits for UNIX's that don't allow this by default.
14). Fix to dynamically allocate group array for setgroups. Don't
depend on NGROUPS_MAX being correctly defined in header files.
15). Fix for crash bug in floating point in snprintf.
16). "Safe" version of popen() included to allow use in code such
as "source environment" patch.
17). Fix for SWAT for trailing '\n' in asctime().
18). Wildcard match fix from weidel@multichart.de for NT wildcard
processing.
19). unix_mask_match fixes for "veto files" parameter.
20). Fix for system call bug when configuring on Linux kernel 2.0.x
with glibc2.1.x.
21). SO_REUSEPORT socket option added for HPUX.
22). All recv() calls changed back to read() to fix Solaris 2.5.x bug.
23). Some UNICODE conversion fixes. Not complete yet.
24). NetShareEnum fix for Windows 2000. Don't ask for 64K as Win2k
can't cope with this (returns "Out of memory" error).
25). Fixes for cli_error() crashes.
26). Fix for crash when connecting to password server by DNS name
not NetBIOS name.
27). Fix bug in demangling of compacted NetBIOS names.
28). Fixes for slow locking code for VMS.
29). Reply to short NetLogon packet in nmbd with short reply.
30). Correctly allign userdata to prevent crashes in nmbd.
31). Use talloc() in string buffer rotation code to prevent overwrites.
32). Added multi-byte awareness to parameter loading code.
33). Re-wrote password file modification code. We can now delete users
atomically. Original patch from Bruce Tenison.
34). Fixed bug in parsing smbpasswd type entries.
35). Fixes from HP to the windows registry RPC emulation.
36). Added ability to return RPC fault PDU to unknown calls. Needed to
allow Windows 2000 to return UNIX permissions as NT ACLs.
37). utmp code patch from T.D.Lee@durham.ac.uk. Not available on all
platforms - test with ./configure.
38). Inherit permissions fix from David Lee.
39). Added write caching code for oplocked files.
40). Workaround for new bug in Windows 2000 where NT file create using
NTtransact call sends UNICODE without bothering to set the UNICODE flag
bit.
41). Workaround for new bug in Windows 2000 where it attempts to re-write
existing ACLs to make them inherit only.
42). Removed unused mmap code.
43). Added correct implementation of share mode deny table. We now match
Windows NT.
44). Fix recursion bug with group enumeration.
45). Fix from Bjart Kvarme to take into account changed machine passwords
that haven't yet propagated from PDC to BDC.
46). Correctly skip two byte length field when accepting RPC "start of
message" packets in SMBwriteX on pipes.
47). Added auto-detection of Windows 2000 clients.
48). Fix bug with rollback of POSIX locks if a lock in a range fails to
apply.
49). Fix bug with registering startup smbd's in flat file.

from Christoph Pfisterer.
54). Fix for WINS server code where "do you still want name?" request was
being sent to the wrong IP address.
55). Fixed "recursion desired" bits set in nmbd so we are identical to
Windows NT.
56). nmbd now should process logon packets from Win95, Win98 and both
versions of the NT logon packet.
57). Correctly set parameter offset value for first trans2 reply.
58). Win2K will only accept volume labels in UNICODE.
59). Ensure nmbd doesn't attempt to use the loopback interface when
registering names.
60). Fixed bug where smbd didn't return '.' or '..' on top level
share directory listing.
61). Fix for soft quotas not being set (make them equal to hardquota)
from Norbert Püschel (Pueschel.Norbert@Walzbarren-VAW.ne.uunet.de).
62). SWAT fixes for SCO UnixWare (SIGPIPE handling).
63). Fix for nmbd DOS with redirect recursion.
64). Fix for log files growing without bound from Mattias Gronlund.
65). Fix for smbd crash bug in truncate is locked.
66). Memory leak fix in mangle name code.

Older release notes for Samba 2.0.x follow.

Previous Release notes for 2.0.6
---------------------------------

New/Changed parameters in 2.0.6
-------------------------------

There are 6 new parameters in the smb.conf file.

wins hook

This parameter allows an external program to be called
on all changes to a Samba WINS database, allowing dynamic
DNS updates.

debug hires timestamp
debug pid
debug uid

The above 3 parameters provide greater debug information.

preexec close
rootpreexec close

The above 2 parameters control the action taken on the
success or failure of a 'preexec' script.

There is also one removed parameter.

mangle locks

The addition of these new parameters and the removal of the old
is described in more detail in the smb.conf man page,

When using "security=domain" the "password server"
parameter can now be set to the string "*', which will
cause Samba to search for Domain controllers in the
same way that Windows NT does. See the smb.conf man
page for more details.

The "interfaces" parameter in smb.conf can now be dynamically
detected on startup and can also now take an interface name
such as eth0. See the smb.conf man page for the details
on the new features of the "interfaces" parameter.
nmbd has been enhanced to use this feature.

The syntax for the Linux-specific smbmount command has been changed
and is now compatible with the standard mount command. See the modified
smbmount man page for details.

Support for the UNIX CUPS printer standard has been added.
See www.cups.org for details. Thanks to the folks at Easy Software
Products for this code. Set the printcap name to "cups" to
enable this. See the smb.conf man page for details.

Changes in 2.0.6
-----------------

1). 64-bit locking removed from Linux autoconf build. This fixes
several Linux specific locking issues.
2). Crash bug fix in smbclient recursive processing. Fix from
E. Jay Berkenbilt (ejb@ql.org).
3). "history" command added to smbclient if readline available.
4). smbtar - updates files and directory message on restore.
5). smbmnt - 'u', 'g', 'r', 'f', 'd' options added by Andrew. See
man page for details.
6). smbmount updated to be useable by autofs on Linux. See the
samba/examples/autofs/README file for details.
7). Bug fixed where TCP_NODELAY was not being used by default in smbd.
8). Many oplock fixes. Samba now waits 30 seconds, not 45. Also
smbd no longer aborts on client break failure, but logs a message
and continues. This is what NT does. This should fix many "oplock
break" message problems people have been having.
9). New code from Andrew to dynamically detect interfaces. nmbd will
now attempt to dynamically detect interface changes and register names
as an interface goes "up".
10). Win95 ioctl for print jobs added by Matt.
11). Mapping for ISO8859-1 extended for codepage 437 and 850.
12). Code Page 737 -> ISO-8859-7 (Greek-Hellenic) mapping added.
13). Character strings now correctly converted from UNIX character set
format to DOS codepage when read from smb.conf or external passwd or
group files. Samba is now much more careful about what format external
strings should be converted to/from.
14). snprintf crash fix for IRIX 6.2 and below.
15). Increased timestamp debug fixes (adds milliseconds and uid/pid if
requested).
16). Optimisation for wildcard exact match requests.
17). Win95 wildcard semantics fix - unused code removed.
18). 'mangle locks' parameter removed. This now done automatically.
19). setXid() routines re-written to provide asserts and also to fix
AIX versions prior to 4.1.x.
20). MSG_WAITALL optimisation removed due to bugs in FreeBSD.
21). Length fix when writing UNICODE string.
22). oplock processing added to libsmb client code.
23). Added more client error message strings.
24). Fix bug with connecting to encrypted server when non-encrypted
password given.
25). In security=domain, password server extended to search for DC's
if parameter = '*'.
26). "root did not create samaphore" bug fixed.
27). random generator initialized early to prevent icons not showing
up in Win9x.
28). Logging fix after SIGHUP.
29). WINS hook external call added when nmbd is a WINS server.
30). Support for CUPS printer protocol added by Michael Sweet.
31). Support for NIS+ backend password database updates.
32). Handle dashes in print job id's. Fix from Dom.Mitchell@palmerharvey.co.uk
33). Race condition in UNIX password sync on some platforms fixed by Matt.
34). Dirptr leak from Win98 fixed.
35). Logic bug in handling of level II oplocks fixed.
36). smbd crash bug fix when opening directories.
37). Paranoia oplock fix from Charles Hoch (hoch@exemplary.com)
38). Fix Win2k problem where DCE/RPC is done on SMBwrite as well as SMBwriteX.
39). Fix Win95 redirector alignment bug that caused oplock break failures.
40). Preexec close code added.
41). Extra sanity checks in testparm code.
42). oplock tests added to smbtorture.
43). Tell SWAT user if logged in as root or not.
44). Solaris packaging fixes donated by VERITAS.

Previous Release notes for 2.0.5a
---------------------------------

IMPORTANT NOTE !
----------------

Version 2.0.5a of Samba contains three security bugfixes for
problems in previous versions of Samba found by Olaf Kirch of
Caldera Systems (www.caldera.com). The Samba Team would like
to publicly thank Olaf for his help in doing a security review
of our code and finding these bugs.

The three bugs are one potentially exploitable buffer overrun
bug (although no current exploits are known) in smbd and two
denial of service bugs in nmbd. By default the smbd bug was not
exploitable as shipped (the problem parameter was disabled by
default) but instructions on protecting any version of Samba
prior to 2.0.5 are included below.

All these bugs have been fixed in Samba 2.0.5 and 2.0.5a.

If using any version of Samba prior to 2.0.5 the administrator
*MUST NOT* enable the "message command" parameter in smb.conf,
and *MUST* remove any "message command" that is listed in any
existing smb.conf file. No known instances of this attack being
exploited have been reported.

All Samba versions of nmbd prior to 2.0.5 are vulnerable to a
denial of service attack causing nmbd to either crash or to go
into an infinite loop. No known instances of this attack being
exploited have been reported.

New/Changed parameters in 2.0.5 and 2.0.5a.
-------------------------------------------

There are 5 new parameters in the smb.conf file.

security mask
force security mode
directory security mask
force directory secruty mode
level2 oplocks

The first 4 parameters are used to control the UNIX permissions bits
that an NT client is allowed to modify. These parameters are now
used instead of the older "create" parameters that were used in
2.0.4 to allow an administrator to separate the two functions.

Use of these new parameters is described in the smb.conf man page,
and also in the documents :

docs/textdocs/NT_Security.txt
docs/htmldocs/NT_Security.html

The fifth new parameter is described in the following section.

Level II oplocks
----------------

Samba 2.0.5 now implements level2 oplocks. As this is new
code this parameter is set to "off" by default. The benefit
of level2 oplocks is to allow read-only file caching from
multiple clients. This is of great speed benefit to shares
that are serving application executable programs (.EXE's)
that are usually not written to. To learn more about using
level 2 oplocks read the parameter description in the smb.conf
documentation or read the file :

docs/textdocs/Speed.txt.

Changes in 2.0.5a
-----------------

1). Fix for smbd crash bug in string_sub(). smbd was miscalculating
memmove lengths on multiple '%' substitutions.
2). Fix for wildcard matching bug for old DOS programs running on Win9x.
3). Fix for Windows NT client changing passwords against a Samba server,
intermittently failing.
4). Fix for PPP link being detected as primary interface if using the
same IP address as the primary.
5). Ensure smbmount is built with RPM build.

Changes in 2.0.5
----------------

1). smbmount for Linux systems has been re-written to use
the libsmb code and clientutil.c is no longer used with it.
2). A bug preventing directory opens using the NT SMB calls
has been fixed.
3). A related bug causing a file structure leak when directory
opens were denied has been fixed.
4). Fix for glibc2.1 bug on 32-bit systems being reported as 64
bit.
5). Prevent timestamps of 0 or -1 corrupting file timestamps.
6). Fix for unusual delays when browsing shares using Windows
2000 - fix added by Matt.
7). Fix for smbpassword reading problems on Sparc Linux was fixed.
8). Fix for compiling with SSL library.
9). smbclient fix for crash when doing CR/LF conversion.
10). smbclient now reports short read errors.
11). smbclient now uses remote server workgroup to list servers by default.
12). smbclient now has -b option to change transmit/send buffer size.
13). smbclient fix for corrupting files when issuing multiple outstanding
read requests.
14). Printing bug where Linux was using SYSV printing by default fixed.
Linux now set to be BSD printing by default.
15). Change for Linux to use SYSV shared memory by default.
16). Fix for using IP_TOS options on some systems.
17). Fix for some systems that complained about static struct passwd
buffers being modified.
18). Range checking applied to all string substitutions. Theoretically
not a bug, but much more rebust now.
19). Level II oplocks implemented.
20). Fix for Win2K client printing added.
21). Always allow loopback (127.0.0.1) connects unless specifically denied.
22). Patch for FreeBSD interface detection code from Archie Cobbs (archie@whistle.com).
23). Return correct status from smbrun.
24). snprintf fixes for floating point numbers.
25). Force directories to always have zero size.
26). Fix for "force group" and "force user" options. "force user" now
always uses primary group of user as well. Force group now enhanced with '+'
semantics (see smb.conf man page for details).
27). Wildcard matching fix to get closer to WinNT semantics for Win9x clients.
28). Potential crash bug fixed in wildcard matching code. This bug could also
cause smbd to sometimes not see exact file matches.
29). Read/write for sockets changed to use revc/send to allow optimisations
later.
30). Oplocks added to client library.
31). Several purify fixes in IPC code.
32). nmbd crash bug in processing strange NetBIOS names fixed.
33). nmbd loop bug in processing strange NetBIOS names fixed.
34). Paranoia fixes to processing of incoming WinPopup messages in smbd.
35). Share mode code now auto initialised.
36). Detect dead processes in IPC lock code.
37). Explicit -V version switch added to command line processing.
38). WORKGROUP(1b) name processing with no WINS server fixed.
39). Win2k client detection code added by Matt.
40). Fix to allow really short changenotify times to be honoured.
41). Fix for NT delete finding the wrong file from Tine Smukavec
(valentin.smukavec@hermes.si)
42). SWAT fix to prevent stderr messages from breaking the Web client.
43). testparm fixes to check more parameter conflicts.
44). Relative paths not fetched via SWAT in CGI scripts.
45). SWAT remote password change - remote host name not treated as a
password field any more.

Changes in 2.0.4b
-----------------

A bug with MS-Word 97 saving files with zero UNIX permissions
was fixed. Even though a workaround is available (set force
create mode = 644 on the share) Word is such an important
application that a point fix was neccessary.

Changes in 2.0.4a
-----------------

The text and html versions of NT_Security were missing from
the shipping tarball. Also a compile bug for platforms that
don't have usleep was fixed.

Changes in 2.0.4
----------------

There are 5 new parameters and one modified parameter in
the smb.conf file.

allow trusted domains
restrict anonymous
mangle locks
oplock break wait time
oplock contention limit

The modified parameter is :

nt acl support

Bugfixes added since 2.0.3
--------------------------

1). Fix for 8 character password problem when using HPUX and
plaintext passwords.
2). --with-pam option added to ./configure.
3). Client fixes for memory leak and display of 64 bit values.
4). Fixes for -E and -s option with smbclient.
5). smbclient now allows -L //server or -L \\server
6). smbtar fix for display of 64 bit values.
7). Endian independence added to DCE/RPC code.
8). DCE/RPC marshalling/unmarshalling code re-written to provide
overflow reporting and sign and seal support.
9). Bind NAK reply packet added to DCE/RPC code, used to correctly
refuse bind requests (prevents NT system event log messages).
10). Mapping of UNIX permissions into NT ACL's for get and set
added.
11). DCE/RPC enumeration of numbers of shares made dynamic. 
Samba now has no limit on the number of exported shares seen.
12). Fix to speed up random number seed generation on /dev/urandom
being unavailable.
13). Several memory fixes added by running Purify on the code.
14). Read from client error messages improved.
15). Fixed endianness used in UNICODE strings.
16). Cope with ERRORmoredata in an RPC pipe client call.
17). Check for malformed responses in nmbd register name.
18). NT Encrypted password changing from the NT password dialog box
now fully implmented.
19). Mangle 64-bit lock ranges into 32-bits (NT bug!) on a 32-bit
Samba platform.
20). Allow file to be pseudo-openend in order to read security only.
21). Improve filename mangling to reduce chance of collisions.
22). Added code to prevent granting of oplocks when a file is under
contention.
23). Added tunable wait time before sending an oplock break request
to a client if the client caused the break request. Helps with clients
not responding to oplock breaks.
24). Always respond negatively to queued local oplock break messages
before shutdown. This can prevent "freezes" on an oplock error.
25). Allow admin to restrict logons to correct domain when in domain
level security.
26). Added "restrict anonymous" patch from Andy (thwartedefforts@wonky.org)
to prevent parameter substitution problems with anonymous connections.
27). Fix SMBseek where seeking to a negative number sets the offset
to zero.
28). Fixed problem with mode getting corrupted in trans2 request
(setting to zero means please ignore it).
29). Correctly become the authenticated user on an authenticated
DCE/RPC pipe request.
30). Correctly reset debug level in nmbd if someone set it on the
command line.
31). Added more checking into testparm
32). NetBench simulator added to smbtorture by Andrew.
33). Fixed NIS+ option compile (was broken in 2.0.3).
34). Recursive smbclient directory listing fix. Patch from E. Jay Berkenbilt
(ejb@ql.org)

Bugfixes added since 2.0.2

when restoring tar files.
4). Some automount fixes for smbmount.
5). Attempt to fix the AIX 4.1.x/3.x problems where smbd runs as
root. As no-one has given us root access to such a server this
cannot be tested fully, but should work.
6). Crash bug fix in debug code where *real* uid rather than 
*effective* uid was being checked before attempting to rotate
log files. This fix should help a *lot* of people who were
reporting smbd aborting in the middle of a copy operation.
7). SIGALRM bugfix to ensure infinate file locks time out.
8). New code to implement NT ACL reporting for cacls.exe program.
9). UDP loopback socket rebind fix for Solaris.
10). Ensure all UNICODE strings are correctly in little-endian
format.
11). smbpasswd file locking fix.
12). Fixes for strncpy problems with glibc2.1.
13). Ensure smbd correctly reports major and minor version number
and server type when queried via NT rpc calls.
14). Bugfix for short mangled names not being pulled off the
mangled stack correctly.
15). Fix for mapping of rwx bits being incorrectly overwritten
when doing ATTRIB.EXE
16). Fix for returning multiple PDU packets in NT rpc code. Should
allow multiple shares to be returned correctly).
17). Improved mapping of NT open access requests into UNIX open
modes.
18). Fix for copying files from an NTFS volume that contain
multiple data forks. Added 'magic' error code NT needs.
19). Fixed crash bug when primary NT authentication server
is down, rolls over to secondaries correctly now.
20). Fixed timeout processing to be timer based. Now will
always occur even if smbd is under load.
21). Fixed signed/unsigned problem in quotas code.
22). Fixed bug where setting the password of a completely fresh
user would end up setting the account disabled flag.
23). Improved user logon messages to help admins having
trouble with user authentication.

Bugfixes added since 2.0.1
--------------------------

Note that due to a critical signal handling bug in 2.0.1,
this release has been removed and replaced immediately with 
2.0.2. The Samba Team would like to apologise for any problem
this may have caused.

1). Fixed smbd looping on SIGCLD problem. This was
    caused by a missing break statement in a critical
    piece of code.

Bugfixes added since 2.0.0
--------------------------

1). Autoconf changes for gcc2.7.x and Solaris 2.5/2.6
2). Autoconf changes to help HPUX configure correctly.
3). Autoconf changes to allow lock directory to be set.
4). Client fix to allow port to be set.
5). clitar fix to send debug messages to stderr.
6). smbmount race condition fix.
7). Fix for bug where trying to browse large numbers of shares
    generated an error from an NT client.
8). Wrapper for setgroups for SunOS 4.x
9). Fix for directory deleting failing from multiuser NT.
10). Fix for crash bug if bitmap was full.
11). Fix for Linux genrand where /dev/random could cause 
     clients to timeout on connect if the entropy pool was
     empty.
12). The default PASSWD_CHAT may now be overridden in local.h
13). HPUX printing fixes for default programs.
14). Reverted (erroneous) code in MACHINE.SID generation that
     was setting the sid to 0x21 - should be *decimal* 21.
15). Fix for printing to remote machine under SVR4.
16). Fix for chgpasswd wait being interrupted with EINTR.
17). Fix for disk free routine. NT and Win98 now correctly

Major changes in Samba 2.0
--------------------------

This is a MAJOR new release of Samba, the UNIX based SMB/CIFS file 
and print server for Windows systems.

There have been many changes in Samba since the last major release,
1.9.18.  These have mainly been in the areas of performance and
SMB protocol correctness.  In addition, a Web based GUI interface
for configuring Samba has been added.

In addition, Samba has been re-written to help portability to
other POSIX-based systems, based on the GNU autoconf tool.

There are many major changes in Samba for version 2.0.  Here are 
some of them:

=====================================================================

1). Speed
---------

Samba has been benchmarked on high-end UNIX hardware as out-performing
all other SMB/CIFS servers using the Ziff-Davis NetBench benchmark.
Many changes to the code to optimise high-end performance have been made.

2). Correctness
---------------

Samba now supports the Windows NT specific SMB requests.  This
means that on platforms that are capable Samba now presents a
64 bit view of the filesystem to Windows NT clients and is
capable of handling very large files.

3). Portability
---------------

Samba is now self-configuring using GNU autoconf, removing
the need for people installing Samba to have to hand configure
Makefiles, as was needed in previous versions.

You now configure Samba by running "./configure" then "make".  See
docs/textdocs/UNIX_INSTALL.txt for details.

4). Web based GUI configuration
-------------------------------

Samba now comes with SWAT, a web based GUI config system.  See
the swat man page for details on how to set it up.

5). Cross protocol data integrity
---------------------------------

An open function interface has been defined to allow 
"opportunistic locks" (oplocks for short) granted by Samba
to be seen by other UNIX processes.  This allows complete
cross protocol (NFS and SMB) data integrety using Samba
with platforms that support this feature.

6). Domain client capability
----------------------------

Samba is now capable of using a Windows NT PDC for user
authentication in exactly the same way that a Windows NT
workstation does, i.e. it can be a member of a Domain.  See
docs/textdocs/DOMAIN_MEMBER.txt for details.

7). Documentation Updates
-------------------------

All the reference parts of the Samba documentation (the
manual pages) have been updated and converted to a document
format that allows automatic generation of HTML, SGML, and
text formats.  These documents now ship as standard in HTML
and manpage format.

=====================================================================

NOTE - Some important option defaults changed
---------------------------------------------

Several parameters have changed their default values.  The most
important of these is that the default security mode is now user
level security rather than share level security.

This (incompatible) change was made to ease new Samba installs
as user level security is easier to use for Windows 95/98 and
Windows NT clients.

********IMPORTANT NOTE****************

If you have no "security=" line in the [global] section of 
your current smb.conf and you update to Samba 2.0 you will
need to add the line :

security=share

to get exactly the same behaviour with Samba 2.0 as you
did with previous versions of Samba.

********END IMPORTANT NOTE*************

In addition, Samba now defaults to case sensitivity options that
match a Windows NT server precisely, that is, case insensitive 
but case preserving.

The default format of the smbpasswd file has also been
changed for this release, although the new tools will read
and write the old format, for backwards compatibility.

=====================================================================

NOTE - Primary Domain Controller Functionality
----------------------------------------------

This version of Samba contains code that correctly implements
the undocumented Primary Domain Controller authentication
protocols.  However, there is much more to being a Primary
Domain Controller than serving Windows NT logon requests.

A useful version of a Primary Domain Controller contains
many remote procedure calls to do things like enumerate users, 
groups, and security information, only some of which Samba currently
implements. In addition, there are outstanding (known) bugs with
using Samba as a PDC in this release that the Samba Team are actively
working on. For this reason we have chosen not to advertise and 
actively support Primary Domain Controller functionality with this
release.

This work is being done in the CVS (developer) versions of Samba,
development of which continues at a fast pace.  If you are
interested in participating in or helping with this development
please join the Samba-NTDOM mailing list.  Details on joining
