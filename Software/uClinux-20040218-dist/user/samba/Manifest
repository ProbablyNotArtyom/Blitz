Directory	Notes:
=========	======

docs		(Samba Documentation):
----		----------------------

	The Samba documentation for the 2.0 release has had all the man pages
	converted to YODL source format. Because of this the man pages
	are now available in both traditional man page format (in
	the doc/manpages directory) and in HTML format (in the 
	docs/htmldocs directory).

	The text documentation files have been moved into a
	docs/textdocs directory and are in the (slow) process
	of being converted to YODL source format to allow them
	to be easily converted to HTML/SGML.
    
	Note in particular two files - docs/textdocs/<your OS>_INSTALL.txt 
	and docs/textdocs/DIAGNOSIS.txt.

	There is the potential for there to be many *INSTALL.txt files, one
	for each OS that Samba supports. However we are moving all this into
	the new structure. For now, most people will be using UNIX_INSTALL.txt.

	Please pay close attention to all the files with a .txt extension
	in the docs/textdocs directory. Most problems can be solved by reference
	to the two files mentioned.

	The FAQ documentation can be accessed starting from Samba-meta-FAQ.html,
	in the docs/faq directory. This is incomplete, but to quote from the 
	abstract, it:
	
	"contains overview information for the Samba suite of programs, 
	a quick-start guide, and pointers to all other Samba documentation. 
	Other FAQs exist for specific client and server issues, and HOWTO 
	documents for more extended topics to do with Samba software."


examples	(Example configuration files):
--------	------------------------------

	Please pay close attention to the reference smb.conf file
	smb.conf.default that has now been included as the master guide.

	Do read the smb.conf manual page in considering what settings are
	appropriate for your site.


packaging	(Only for those wishing to build binary distributions):
---------	-------------------------------------------------------

	Currently support is included for the following Linux Distributions :
	
		Pacfic HiTech, RedHat and SuSE.

	In addition, packaging support is available for SGI and Solaris systems.
	We hope that other Unix OS vendors will contribute their binary
	distribution packaging control files - and we hope to make their binary
	packages available on the master ftp site under:

		ftp://samba.org/pub/samba/Binary_Packages/"OS_Vendor"


source		(The official Samba source files - expect more of these!):
------		----------------------------------------------------------

	To build your own binary files you will need a suitable ansi C
	compiler.

	For Samba 2.0 the GNU autoconf system has been adopted. In
	order to build a default Samba for your platform cd into
	the source/ directory and then type :

		./configure

	followed by :

		make

	To install the binaries built by the above type :

		make install
 
	then set up your configuration files.

	NOTE: OS Vendors who provide Samba binary packages will generally
	integrate all Samba files into their preferred directory locations.
	These may differ from the default location ALWAYS used by the Samba
	sources. Please be careful when upgrading a vendor provided binary
	distribution from files you have built yourself.
