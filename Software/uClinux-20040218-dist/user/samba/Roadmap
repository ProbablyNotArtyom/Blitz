The Samba-Team are committed to an aggressive program to deliver quality
controlled software to a well defined roadmap.

The current Samba release 2.0.4 is called the "NT Security update".

It correctly implements the Windows NT specific SMB calls,
and will operate correctly as a client in a Windows NT
Domain environment.

In addition, the first implementation of the Web-based GUI
management tool ships with 2.0.0, thus fullfilling some of
the commitments made in the 1.9.18 release Roadmap document.

Some work has been done on ensuring compatibility with
Windows NT 5.0 (now Windows 2000 :-) although this is
a somewhat (slowly) moving target.

The following development objectives for future releases
are in place:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.0.x       -   "NT Security update" - Allowing Windows NT Clients to
                manipulate file security and ownership using native tools.

Note that the "NT Security update" part of the Roadmap has been
achieved with the Samba 2.0.4 release.

2.0.xx      -   "Thin Server" mode, allowing a Samba server to be
                inserted into a network with no UNIX setup required.
                Some management capabilities for Samba using native NT tools.
                Provision of command-line equivalents to native NT tools.

2.X         -   "Domain Controller" - able to serve as a Windows NT PDC.

X.XX        -   "Full Domain Integration" - allowing both PDC and BDC modes.

Note that it is a given that the Samba Team will continue to track
Windows (NT/2000) update releases, ensuring that Samba will work
well with whatever "Beta" releases Redmond throws our way :-).

You may also note that the release numbers get fuzzier the
further into the future the objectives get. This is intentional
as we cannot yet commit to exact timeframes.
