This is the Algol 60 interpreter NASE A60 (now around version 0.17).
Made for fun and call-by-name.

The NASE A60 interpreter is free software.  See the file COPYING for
copying permission.

About compiling and installation see the file INSTALL.

NASE A60 is based on the ``Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language
Algol 60'' (The file RRA60.texinfo contains a source form of the
report; it is not covererd by the COPYING permissions).

The I/O section of the interpreter is not complete at all, but basic
things are now working.

About the interpreter:  There is now the a60.texinfo documentation,
but not finished at all - sorry.

Additionally there is the ``xa60'' frontend: a simple edit-and-go X11
application. 

In the micro directory there are additional Makefiles for compiling for
MSDOS, etc.


Have fun.
