Installation of the Algol 60 Interpreter
****************************************


A60 is still running on Un*x machines and PC's.



Installation for Un*x
=====================


Glance through the Makefile and change the FLAGS as appropriate:


`USG'
     	define this compiling for an SystemV Un*x. For a BSD system
     	define nothing; this is the default.

`VPRINTF_MISSING'
     	define this, if your system does not provide the vprintf ()
     	call. This is used in err.c.

`REALLOC_MISSING'
     	define this, if your system does not provide the realloc ()
     	call. This is used in util.c.

`NO_LIMITS_H'
     	define this, if your system have no header limits.h, defining
     	`LONG_MIN' and `LONG_MAX'.  (don't care: set it if
     	you're in doubt)

`DEBUG'
     	define this, if you like to include general debug code (normally
     	you will not).

`PARSEDEBUG'
     	define this, if you like to include the debug code for the
     	parser (normally you will not).

`MEMORY_STATISTICS'
     	define this, if you like to include some code for statistics of
     	used heap and stack amount (normally you will not).

`NO_ENUMS'
     	define this, if your compiler nukes on enums and you have
     	changed the enum declarations in the header files. Look to
     	ENUM.README for more about (normally you will not).



Say `make' to compile.

If yoy like to make the simple edit-and-go xa60 application, say
`make xa60'.


If you like to run the testsuite, say `make test' and hopefully no
differences between the expected output and the actual output are found.


For installation adjust BINDIR to point to the destination for the
"a60" binary.  LIBDIR to point to the destination of the
"a60-mkc.inc" file. If you don't want this, set to `/tmp'; it is only
used, if C output should be compiled.  MANDIR and MANSUFF are used for
installation of the "a60.man" manual page.

Say `make install' to install the binary, the manpage and the
include-file.

Say `make xa60-install' to install the xa60 binary and the xa60
manpage. 



Installation for PC's
=====================


I've compiled the sources with QuickC v2.0 using qc-makeit.bat. The
project file is qc-a60.mak. The compiler itself is short of memory,
if running the optimiser, so the a60-ptab.c module better is compiled
without.

C code generation is possible, but I've tried it only with few examples,
because the created large macros cannot be compiled properly.
