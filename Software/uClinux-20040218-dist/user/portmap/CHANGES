@(#) CHANGES 1.1 96/05/31 15:50:39

Changes with release 4 (May 1996)

The old code could not handle more than 16 interface addresses per
host. With virtual hosting, a system can have more than 16 addresses.
We now allocate memory dynamically.

Support for AIX 4.1. Just like 4.4 BSD, it has variable-length sockaddr
structures. Build with -DHAS_SA_LEN.

Support for NextStep 3.2. This is a pre-posix system without setsid().

Support for Digital UNIX on the Alpha. On these machines, long and int
are not interchangeable.
