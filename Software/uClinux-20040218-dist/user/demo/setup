Connect the SE1100 with the node 1 SE2900 using a red (cross over) cable.
Connect the node 2 SE2900 to the laptop using a red (cross over) cable.
Insert both wireless cards into the SE2900s.

Plug the magic control box into the SE1100.  This contains two switches and
three LEDs.  Their functions are:

	switch 1 - override message display for 1 minute
	switch 2 - take snapshot
	led 1    - indicator for switch 1 (1 minute)
	led 2    - indicator for switch 2 (2 seconds)
	led 3    - morse code output


Power on sequence is:
	SE1100, node 1 and finally node 2.
All network activity is initiated from later power ups to earlier.


Set a web brower on the laptop to point at 192.168.161.31:8000/cgi-bin/snapshot
This will display a pair of pictures and it auto-refreshes every ten seconds.


Test the scales and display.  The display message file is located in
/etc/display_messages on node 2.  Edit this file and it will automagically
change the display.  Messages appear roughly once per thirty second.
