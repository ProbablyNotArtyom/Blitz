for details.


   The PCI Utilities package contains a library for portable access to PCI bus
configuration space and several utilities based on this library. Current
version works only on Linux and also has an experimental support for FreeBSD,
but it can be easily extended to work on other systems as well.

   The utilities include:  (See manual pages for more details)

	- lspci: displays detailed information about all PCI busses and devices
	  in the system, replacing the original /proc/pci interface.

	- setpci: allows to read from and write to PCI device configuration
	  registers. For example, you can adjust the latency timers with it.

   The library (and therefore all the utilities) can access PCI registers
either via the /proc/bus/pci interface present since Linux 2.1.82 or
via direct hardware access (to be used with older kernels and also for
hardware diagnostics). It's also capable of reading and interpreting
register dumps printed by `lspci -x'. Unfortunately, there is no documentation
on how to use the library yet, so if you want to play with it, just ask
me for whatever you want.

   To compile the package, just run "make". To install it, "make install".

   If you have any bug reports or suggestions, send them to the author.

   If you want, subscribe to linux-pci@atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz (send
"subscribe linux-pci Your Full Name" to listproc@atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz).
Release notes about new versions will be send to the list and problems with
the Linux PCI support will be probably discussed there, too.

   You also might want to look at the pciutils web page containing release
notes and other news: http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~mj/pciutils.html .

   There also exists a utility called PowerTweak which is able to fine tune
parameters of many chipsets much better than the Bridge Optimization code
in Linux kernel (already removed in 2.3.x). See http://linux.powertweak.com/
for more information.
