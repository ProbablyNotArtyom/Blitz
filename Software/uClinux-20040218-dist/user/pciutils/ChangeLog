	glibc.

Mon Jan 24 11:24:43 2000  Martin Mares  <mj@albireo.ucw.cz>

	* Makefile: Modified to work with the Linux FHS brain-damaged idea
	of putting man pages to /usr/share/man. Now we choose either /usr/man
	or /usr/share/man depending on which one exists.

Sun Jan 23 10:52:34 2000  Martin Mares  <mj@albireo.ucw.cz>

	* lspci.c (show_htype2): Don't forget a TAB before the "I/O window" line.

Tue Sep 14 09:31:01 1999  Martin Mares  <mj@albireo.ucw.cz>

	* pci.ids: New ID's. Again.

Thu Aug  5 17:45:42 1999  Martin Mares  <mj@albireo.ucw.cz>

	* lspci.c (show_size): Don't show size if it's zero (usually
	due to bus-centric mode being enabled).

Tue Jul 20 13:25:09 1999  Martin Mares  <mj@albireo.ucw.cz>

	* lib/pci.h: Types are OS dependent.

	* lib/internal.h: Byte order hacks are OS dependent.

	* lib/configure: Recognize FreeBSD. Also set OS_XXX according to the OS.

	* lib/Makefile, lib/access.c: Added fbsd-device target.

	* pci.ids: Added an entry for PLX 9080 bridges with subsystem ID
	incorrectly set to device ID.

	* README: Added a note that we support FreeBSD.

	* Makefile (PREFIX, ROOT): Set it depending on the OS.
	(%.8): Grrr, BSD date is not able to convert date formats the same way
	as GNU date does. Use sed instead.
	(install): Use `-c' when calling install.

	* lib/fbsd-device.c: Added FreeBSD /dev/pci access module contributed
	by Jari Kirma <kirma@cs.hut.fi>.

	* lib/proc.c: Rewrote the pread/pwrite things once again. Use pread
	and pwrite only when we are certain it's safe (i.e., glibc 2.1
	on all architectures or any libc on a i386 where we really know
	how to use syscalls directly). In all other cases, emulate it
	with lseek/read/write.

	* pci.ids: Some more IDs.

Mon Jul 19 14:10:36 1999  Martin Mares  <mj@albireo.ucw.cz>

	* pci.ids: Added IDs of parallel port controller cards as sent
	by Tim Waugh <tim@cyberelk.demon.co.uk>.

Wed Jul  7 00:55:48 1999  Martin Mares  <mj@albireo.ucw.cz>

	* lib/proc.c (proc_scan): HAVE_LONG_ADDRESS instead of HAVE_64BIT_ADDRESS.

	* lspci.c: ADDR_FORMAT now depends on both HAVE_64BIT_ADDRESS and
	HAVE_LONG_ADDRESS.

	* lib/configure: HAVE_64BIT_ADDRESS now doesn't imply that the addresses
	are represented as long long. Introduced a new flag HAVE_LONG_ADDRESS
	to indicate this. Both Sparc architectures now use both 64BIT_ADDRESS
	and LONG_ADDRESS since they have 32-bit userland, but don't set LONG_ADDRESS
	on Alpha.

	* lspci.c (show_msi): Added dumping of the MSI capability.
	(show_slotid): The same for SlotID capability.
	(show_caps): Seperated capability dumping, because it should
	be used for both htype0 and htype1. Even PCI 2.2 doesn't mention
	layout of htype2, so I'm a bit unsure about it wrt capabilities
	-- they at least have to live somewhere else since address 0x34
	is already defined differently in htype2.

	* lib/header.h (PCI_STATUS_UDF): Marked as obsolete (PCI 2.2).
	(PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_MEM_TYPE_1M): Ditto.
	(PCI_CAP_ID_*): Added some new capabilities defined in PCI 2.2.

	* lspci.c (show_htype0): Mask out lowest 2 bits from all capability pointers
	(required by the PCI 2.2 specs).

Mon Jul  5 12:45:19 1999  Martin Mares  <mj@albireo.ucw.cz>

	* lspci.c (show_size): Added new function for dumping of region sizes.
	(show_rom): Added. Now correctly dumps unassigned ROM addresses, disabled
	ROMs et cetera.

	* lib/pci.h (struct pci_dev): known_fields moved to the public part
	of the structure.

	* Added support for region sizes. Needs support in the kernel, because
	sizes have to be scanned before drivers initialize yourself. pci_fill_info()
	now returns a bitmask of what fields were really read.

Mon Jun 28 18:37:51 1999  Dave Jones    <dave@powertweak.com>

	* Makefile:
	  Added `uninstall' target - removes all traces of pciutils.
	* pci.ids:
	  - Lots of cleanups in the ATI, S3, Adaptec vendors.
	  - Changed Compaq QVision 1280/p definitions, as it's not possible
	    to determine the revision from the device ID.
	  - Same for the Tseng ET4000.
	    The id's said I had a rev C, when it was actually a rev B.
	  - Removed some unnecessary strings
	    `PCI'. Unless it's an AGP card, it should be obvious that it's PCI.
	    `Ethernet card'. This should be determined from config space.
	  - Lots of other new vendors & devices
	  - Other additional small cleanups.

Mon Jun 21 22:11:10 1999  Martin Mares  <mj@albireo.ucw.cz>

	* lib/names.c (pci_lookup_name): When device ID lookup
	fails, return hexadecimal device ID instead of vendor ID.
	Well spotted by Axel Bodemann <Axel.Bodemann@ruhr-uni-bochum.de>,
	I've just extended the fix to subsystem ID's.

Thu Jun 17 19:48:21 1999  Martin Mares  <mj@albireo.ucw.cz>

	* lspci.c (show_agp): Bug fix from Petr Vandrovec
	<vandrove@vc.cvut.cz>. The command register was displayed
	incorrectly.

Wed Jun  2 22:42:44 1999  Martin Mares  <mj@albireo.ucw.cz>

	* lib/proc.c (SYS_pread, SYS_pwrite): Use hard-coded
	numbers if not supplied by the libc.

Wed May 19 13:24:39 1999  Martin Mares  <mj@albireo.ucw.cz>

	* Released the whole package as version 2.0.

Fri May 14 22:42:02 1999  Martin Mares  <mj@albireo.ucw.cz>

	* pci.ids: Added several new ID's contributed by people
	on the linux-pci list.

Mon Apr 19 15:21:08 1999  Jakub Jelinek  <jj@ultra.linux.cz>

	* lspci.c: Display I/O addresses correctly on sparc64.
	* lib/header.h: Ditto.

	* lib/configure: On sparc set HAVE_64BIT* as well, we want
	a binary which works on both 32bit and 64bit SPARCs.

Sun Apr 18 21:14:58 1999  Martin Mares  <mj@albireo.ucw.cz>

	* lspci.c, lib/proc.c: Alpha compilation fixes from Matthew Jacob
	<mjacob@feral.com>.

	* pci.ids: A lot of updates from Adam J. Richter <adam@yggdrasil.com>.

Sun Feb 28 22:26:21 1999  Martin Mares  <mj@albireo.ucw.cz>

	* lspci.c (do_map_bus): Don't dump functions 1--7 if not flagged
	as a multi-function device, because several single-function devices
	don't decode the function bits at all.

Sun Feb 14 23:48:22 1999  Martin Mares  <mj@albireo.ucw.cz>

	* Makefile (install): Don't use "-o root -g root" for installation
	since it breaks on machines where programs are not installed by root.
	Reported by Richard Gooch <rgooch@atnf.csiro.au>

Tue Feb  9 15:54:39 1999  Martin Mares  <mj@albireo.ucw.cz>

	* lspci.c (show_bases): Use new address masking macros and pciaddr_t.

	* lib/pci.h: Using pciaddr_t for bus addresses, which are 32-bit
	or 64-bit depending on CPU.

	* lib/pci.h (PCI_ADDR_MEM_MASK): Added macros for address masks
	according to bus address width.

Thu Jan 28 20:54:16 1999  Martin Mares  <mj@albireo.ucw.cz>

	* Released as 1.99.4.

	* lspci.c: Capability list parser now recognizes both AGP
	registers and PCI Power Management registers (the latter
	is mainly guesswork based on DEC/Intel 21153 bridge specs
	since I don't have the PCI Power Management document).

	* lspci.c: Replaced numerous occurences of (x & flag) ? '+' : '-'
	by FLAG macro.

	* lspci.c: Added bridge checks to bus mapping code.

Wed Jan 27 14:59:16 1999  Martin Mares  <mj@albireo.ucw.cz>

	* lspci.c: Implemented bus mapping mode (-M).

	* lspci.c (scan_devices): Split to scan_devices() and scan_device().
	(show): Split to show() and show_device().

	* lib/access.c (pci_init): When a->method == PCI_ACCESS_AUTO,
	set it to the real access method afterwards.

Mon Jan 25 23:46:13 1999  Martin Mares  <mj@albireo.ucw.cz>

	* lib/generic.c (pci_generic_fill_info): If in buscentric mode,
	don't check PCI_COMMAND for I/O and memory enables.

Mon Jan 25 21:28:49 1999  Martin Mares  <mj@albireo.ucw.cz>

	* Makefile: Added target `release' which substitutes new version
	number to .spec, .lsm and README. Also rewrote target `dist'.

	* Released as 1.99.3.

Sun Jan 24 22:10:36 1999  Martin Mares  <mj@albireo.ucw.cz>

	* lib/header.h: Until kernel adopts new layout of PCI
	includes (i.e., separate declaration of header structure,
	functions and device IDs), which is not going to happen
	before 2.3, we'll use our own definiton of the header.

	* lspci.c (show_verbose): Display `Cap' flag in device status.

	* lspci.c (show_htype0): Display capability lists whereever
	available. The only capability name we recognize now is `AGP'.
	Unfortunately, capabilities are stored in device-dependent
	portion of the configuration space and are thus available
	only to root unless you read a dump.

	* lspci.c (scan_devices): Use cache instead of buffering.

	* lib/buffer.c: Removed (obsoleted by the cache).

	* lib/access.c: Added general caching mechanism.

Sat Jan 23 21:30:54 1999  Martin Mares  <mj@albireo.ucw.cz>

	* pci.ids: Added few devices.

Fri Jan 22 19:29:31 1999  Martin Mares  <mj@albireo.ucw.cz>

	(show_verbose): Rewrote interrupt display logic.

	* lib/i386-ports.c: Include sys/io.h only on glibc systems.

	* lib/configure: Rewrote detection of Linux versions. Now it
	works on 2.0 kernels (only with direct/dump access, of course).

	* lib/internal.h: New bytesex macros using <asm/byteorder.h>
	whenever available.

	* lib/proc.c (proc_read, proc_write): Distinguish between short
	read/write and real errors.

	* lspci.c (show_htype{0,1}): Always use d->dev->rom_base_addr since
	libpci respects buscentric mode automatically.

	* lspci.c (show_hex_dump): For CardBus bridges, print out 128
	bytes of header (the whole standard part).

	* common.c: pcilib options are now all uppercase. Also moved
	PCI access debugging option here.

	* Released as 1.99.2.

	* setpci: Rewritten to use the library.

	* Released as 1.99.1.

Tue Jan 19 23:00:12 1999  Martin Mares  <mj@albireo.ucw.cz>

	* lspci.c (scan_devices): For cardbus bridges, read first 128
	bytes of config space to get full standard header.

	* Makefile (CFLAGS): Removed "-Wno-unused".

	* Started the "New Generation" branch and introduced the
	PCI library.
	
	* lspci: Rewritten to use the library.

Tue Jan 19 22:24:08 1999  Martin Mares  <mj@albireo.ucw.cz>

	* Released as version 1.10.

Mon Jan 18 08:51:17 1999  Martin Mares  <mj@albireo.ucw.cz>

	* lspci.8, setpci.8: Miscellaneous fixes as suggested by

Mon Oct 19 21:53:30 1998  Martin Mares  <mj@albireo.ucw.cz>

	* Released as version 1.08.

	* setpci.c: glibc 2.1.x already defines pread() and pwrite().

	* lspci.8: Changed warning about lspci -xxx.

	* lspci.c: Require "-xxx" for full configuration space dump, so that
	it's impossible to crash the machine by single typo.

	* specs: Added (courtesy of Krzysztof G. Baranowski <kgb@knm.org.pl>).

Wed Sep  9 12:03:24 1998  Martin Mares  <mj@albireo.ucw.cz>

	* lspci.c (show_bases): Better displaying of unassigned and
	disabled bases. Thanks to Gabriel Paubert <paubert@iram.es>

	(show_bases): Honor the `cnt' argument.
	(grow_tree): Parse CardBus headers in tree mode as well.

	* pci.h: Updated CardBus header field description. I still don't
	have the CardBus standard available, but OZ6832 specs contain
	full description of all header fields supported by the chip.

Tue Jun  9 22:53:59 1998  Martin Mares  <mj@albireo.ucw.cz>

	* Released as 1.06.

	* names.c (parse_name_list): Killed an unused variable.

	* setpci.c (pread, pwrite): Define SYS_(pread|pwrite) as __NR_\1
	if they are not defined by glibc (needed for glibc built on older
	kernels). Ugly.

	* setpci.c (exec_op): Fixed error messages. Thanks, Steve!

Mon Jun  8 10:59:22 1998  Martin Mares  <mj@albireo.ucw.cz>

	* Released as 1.05.

	* setpci.c: Problems with pread()/pwrite() with glibc on Alpha
	should be gone. Again thanks to Steve for bug report.

	* filter.c (filter_parse_slot): Fixed ":x" type filters.

	* pci.ids: Killed duplicate entry. Thanks to Stephen Williams
	<steve@icarus.com> for reporting this.

	* setpci.c: Finished.

	* lspci.c: Now able to fetch expansion ROM base from kernel device list
	and print it if not in buscentric mode.

Tue Mar 31 23:11:57 1998  Martin Mares  <mj@albireo.ucw.cz>

	* setpci.c: Added.

Thu Mar 19 17:03:48 1998  Martin Mares  <mj@lomikel.karlin.mff.cuni.cz>

	* lspci.c (grow_tree, show_tree_dev, print_it): Fixed displaying
	of PCI-to-PCI bridges in the tree format.

Sun Feb 15 10:12:25 1998  Martin Mares  <mj@albireo.ucw.cz>

	* lspci.c (show_machine): Added non-verbose mode of machine-readable
	dump.

	* pci.ids: Updates from Jens Maurer.

	* Released as version 1.02.

Thu Feb 12 16:53:28 1998  Martin Mares  <mj@lomikel.karlin.mff.cuni.cz>

	* lspci.c: Added a "-m" switch for dumping machine-readable
	configuration data (requested by Bjoern Kriews <bkr@cut.de>).

Mon Feb  9 13:17:43 1998  Martin Mares  <mj@albireo.ucw.cz>

	* Makefile, pciutils.h: Include local pci.h instead of <linux/pci.h>
	if available. This should avoid all problems with official kernel
	not synchronized to newer PCI code in CVS -- standard distribution
	of pciutils now contains pci.h from current CVS kernel, pciutils
	in CVS contain no pci.h and use the correct kernel include.

	* Makefile: Fixed installation path for man pages.

Sat Feb  7 15:15:46 1998  Martin Mares  <mj@albireo.ucw.cz>

	* README: Updated.

	* lspci.8: Created a man page.

	* Releasing as version 1.0.

Tue Feb  3 20:56:00 1998  Martin Mares  <mj@albireo.ucw.cz>

	* Makefile: Recognize architecture by calling uname and pass it as ARCH_xxx
	to all the C sources. This should eliminate problems with 32-bit compilers
	on sparc64.

	* lspci.c (show_verbose): Recognize CardBus bridge header type.
	(show_htype2): Stub routine.
	(scan_config): Write sensible error message if the kernel denies reading of
	upper part of the PCI config space.
