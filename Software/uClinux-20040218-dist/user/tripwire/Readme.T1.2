This is the version 1.2 release of Tripwire.  The file T1.2.tar can be
unpacked using the Unix "tar" command to produce the source,
documentation, and self-test files comprising the distribution.  The
file README describes what Tripwire is and does, and this should be
read first.  We also recommend you read the design document included
in the docs subdirectory as "designdoc.ps" (it is a PostScript file).
If you used a previous version of Tripwire, see the "Changelog" file
and the "WHATSNEW" file as well as the "READE" file.

We recommend you read the "README.FIRST" file and follow the
instructions it contains if you want to build and use Tripwire in the
recommended manner.  This file is new to the v1.2 distribution.

The file T1.2.tar.asc is a PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) detatched
signature.  This is a cryptographic checksum of the T1.2.tar file,
encrypted with Gene Spafford's private key.  Anyone with PGP can verify
the signature by obtaining Spaf's key (from one of the public servers,
for instance, or his WWW page http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/spaf) and
checking the signature against the tar file.  To do this, issue the
command "pgp T1.2.tar.asc".  If the signatures do not match, it
indicates that someone may have tampered with the file -- contact spaf
and Gene Kim at tripwire-request@cs.purdue.edu to get a corrected
copy.

(If you don't have PGP, you'll have to trust that the distribution is
intact.  The MD5 checksum in base 16 322d9ad4e76115691147e1dc54e09d94
if that makes you feel any better, although this file could have been
altered too. :-) You can use "siggen -h1" to generate it).
