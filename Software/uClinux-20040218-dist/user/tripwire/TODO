v1.2:				 Mon Mar 28 16:23:09 MST 1994
    - add device (major, minor) numbers to database.
    - need Ported entries for Motorola stuff
    - need Ported entries for SCO stuff
    - need to mention Bishop's complaint
    - we need to figure out how to handle the new flex stuff.  leaving
	./contrib/config.pre.l.linux won't fly.  BSD/386 also will suffer
	this problem.  (And hurd, too, but they deserve it.)

    - eventually, the list routines should be changed to not tuck the
	varname and varvalue payloads as part of the structures.  it
	was a good idea, and potentially saves mallocs.  but, it is
	no longer possible to use our lists as string tables, because
	realloc() will sometimes free the strings!  

        this is not a big nor pressing issue, but the changed list routines
	breaks some assertions that I made when I coded much of Tripwire.
	(Paul's list routines are still much better than mine!)

v1.1:				 Mon Dec 13 09:38:23 EST 1993
    - add !(num) pruning syntax (thanks Rik Farrow)

v1.0.4:				 Fri Sep  3 11:56:32 EDT 1993

    - add base10 signature printing
    - get tripwire to compile on SCO machines (ash@cellar.demon.co.uk,spaf)
    - tripwire daemon (safdas@moose.gs.com)
    - make -loosedir default behavior
    - monotonically increasing files (rouilj@ra.cs.umb.edu)
    - It should be possible to specify different ignore flags for
      directories and files in these directories, e.g.:
	   =/var/tmp   L-c
	   /var/tmp    E
      (jv@mh.nl)
    - add MD2 grant notice
    - add -partialcheck option (John Rouillard)  (use entrynum)
    - add type classifiers (exclude/include certain types of files -- John
	Rouillard)

    - AT&T Starserver E compiler has problems 
    - add -q option to make Tripwire noisy only when files change
	(Eric Bergren <eric@ee.pdx.edu>)
    - make tests unrunnable from ./test directory (help Spaf?)
    - make MD5 faster (Eugene Zaustinsky)

first net release
v1.0:				 Tue Nov  3 04:37:39 EST 1992

    fix byte "mangling" on MD2, MD4 and Snefru for Cray machines
    fix lurking bug that surfaces in ETA-10 versions
    find out why malloc() sometimes fails in Cray versions

    add -add and -delete command-line options
    database locking \
    tripwire logging / Drew Gonczi has some fascinating ideas...
    regular expression handling in tw.config file
    hook for tar and cpio file parsing
    inclusion of complete and authorative documentation
    add "information mode" that explains inode fields

    change ./aux to some other name so MS-DOS users can unpack the sources!
