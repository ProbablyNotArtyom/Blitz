    As times passes since the initial release of Tripwire, memories
fade, and things that I used to assume as obvious are no longer quite
so clear.  These are some notes I made to help me remember internal
Tripwire implementation details.  Surely other people besides myself
might benefit from this.

Adding new signature routines:
==============================

    Add the files under the ./sigs directory.  Use the md4 directory
as a template -- it needs to know what endian your machine is, which
we glean at compile time in the Tripwire build.  Use md4wrapper.c as a
template for "wrapping" the signature routine to interface with
Tripwire.

    Remember, if you use pltob64(), the signature string will already
be null-terminated.  However, when generating your hex signature, you'll
have to manually affix a null.

    Look next at ./include/config.h.  You'll need to change a couple
of defines, namely the SIGxFUNC and SIGxNAME defines that tell
Tripwire what function to call and what to name the routine.

    Next, edit ./src/Makefile and change the SIGxDIR, OSIGx, and CSIGx
variables at the top of the Makefile.

    Lastly, add a line in the ./include/tripwire.h to include the
signature prototype file.

    Don't forget to change the file ./tests/tw.conf.test to exclude 
those new object files from the Tripwire test suite.

    At the time of this writing, nine of the ten slots are taken.  So
maybe people won't have to (or be able to) add new signature routines
in the future.  :-)
