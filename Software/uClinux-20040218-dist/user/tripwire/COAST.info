Tripwire is a product of the COAST group at Purdue.  The COAST
(Computer Operations, Audit, and Security Technology) project at Purdue
is a multi-researcher, multi-project group focused on security tool
development and technology transfer, education, network security,
security evaluation and assurance, policy and protocol development, and
incident response.  We're trying to direct the majority of our
attention to solutions to important problems in both present and future
non-classified systems.  We are particularly interested in
collaboration with commercial and government entities with real-world
problems we can try to solve.

Our group includes faculty from CS and EE, and support from several
outside sources.  In addition to the faculty, several top students are
working on COAST projects in intrusion detection, network protocols,
virus detection, integrity management, secure patch distribution, and
authentication.  We have other projects we expect to begin in the near
future.  In addition to our existing COAST resources at Purdue, we're
able to draw on expertise from other faculty and research groups within
the department and university, including the Software Engineering
Research Center and the Parallel and Distributed Systems group.

Support for COAST is in the form of gifts and donations, directed
grants, scholarships, and contracted research.  We recognize three
levels of sponsorship, based on contribution.  We encourage donation
of security-related software and hardware to our lab for use in our
on-going research and education programs.
