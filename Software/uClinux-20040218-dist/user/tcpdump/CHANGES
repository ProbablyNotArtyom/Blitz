v3.4 Sat Jul 25 12:40:55 PDT 1998

- Hardwire Linux slip support since it's too hard to detect.

- Redo configuration of "network" libraries (-lsocket and -lnsl) to
  deal with IRIX. Thanks to John Hawkinson (jhawk@mit.edu)

- Added -a which tries to translate network and broadcast addresses to
  names. Suggested by Rob van Nieuwkerk (robn@verdi.et.tudelft.nl)

- Added a configure option to disable gcc.

- Added a "raw" packet printer.

- Not having an interface address is no longer fatal. Requested by John
  Hawkinson.

- Rework signal setup to accommodate Linux.

- OSPF truncation check fix. Also display the type of OSPF packets
  using MD5 authentication. Thanks to Brian Wellington
  (bwelling@tis.com)

- Fix truncation check bugs in the Kerberos printer. Reported by Ezra
  Peisach (epeisach@mit.edu)

- Don't catch SIGHUP when invoked with nohup(1). Thanks to Dave Plonka
  (plonka@mfa.com)

- Specify full install target as a way of detecting if install
  directory does not exist. Thanks to Dave Plonka.

- Bit-swap FDDI addresses for BSD/OS too. Thanks to Paul Vixie
  (paul@vix.com)

- Fix off-by-one bug when testing size of ethernet packets. Thanks to
  Marty Leisner (leisner@sdsp.mc.xerox.com)

- Add a local autoconf macro to check for routines in libraries; the
  autoconf version is broken (it only puts the library name in the
  cache variable name). Thanks to John Hawkinson.

- Add a local autoconf macro to check for types; the autoconf version
  is broken (it uses grep instead of actually compiling a code fragment).

- Modified to support the new BSD/OS 2.1 PPP and SLIP link layer header
  formats.

- Extend OSF ip header workaround to versions 1 and 2.

- Fix some signed problems in the nfs printer. As reported by David
  Sacerdote (davids@silence.secnet.com)

- Detect group wheel and use it as the default since BSD/OS' install
  can't hack numeric groups. Reported by David Sacerdote.

- AIX needs special loader options. Thanks to Jonathan I. Kamens
  (jik@cam.ov.com)

- Fixed the nfs printer to print port numbers in decimal. Thanks to
  Kent Vander Velden (graphix@iastate.edu)

- Find installed libpcap in /usr/local/lib when not using gcc.

- Disallow network masks with non-network bits set.

- Attempt to detect "egcs" versions of gcc.

- Add missing closing double quotes when displaying bootp strings.
  Reported by Viet-Trung Luu (vluu@picard.math.uwaterloo.ca)

  (onno@simplex.nl)

- Avoid solaris compiler warnings. Thanks to Bruce Barnett
  (barnett@grymoire.crd.ge.com)

- Fix rip printer to not print one more route than is actually in the
  packet. Thanks to Jean-Luc Richier (Jean-Luc.Richier@imag.fr) and
  Bill Fenner (fenner@parc.xerox.com)

- Use autoconf endian detection since BYTE_ORDER isn't defined on all systems.

- Fix dvmrp printer truncation checks and add a dvmrp probe printer.
  Thanks to Danny J. Mitzel (mitzel@ipsilon.com)

- Rewrite ospf printer to improve truncation checks.

- Don't parse tcp options past the EOL. As noted by David Sacerdote
  (davids@secnet.com). Also, check tcp options to make sure they ar
  actually in the tcp header (in addition to the normal truncation
  checks). Fix the SACK code to print the N blocks (instead of the
  first block N times).

- Don't say really small UDP packets are truncated just because they
  aren't big enough to be a RPC. As noted by David Sacerdote.

- Added a printer entry for DLT_IEEE802 as suggested by Tak Kushida
  (kushida@trl.ibm.co.jp)

- Check igmp checksum if possible. Thanks to John Hawkinson.

- Made changes for SINIX. Thanks to Andrej Borsenkow
  (borsenkow.msk@sni.de)

- Use autoconf's idea of the top level directory in install targets.
  Thanks to John Hawkinson.

- Avoid infinite loop in tcp options printing code. Thanks to Jeffrey
  Mogul (mogul@pa.dec.com)

- Avoid using -lsocket in IRIX 5.2 and earlier since it breaks snoop.
  Thanks to John Hawkinson.

- Added some more packet truncation checks.

- On systems that have it, use sigset() instead of signal() since
  signal() has different semantics on these systems.

- Fixed some more alignment problems on the alpha.

- Fixes for AIX (although this system is not yet supported). Thanks to
  John Hawkinson.

- Fix bugs in the autoconf misaligned accesses code fragment.

- Include sys/param.h to get BYTE_ORDER in a few places. Thanks to

- Fix an alignment endian bug in getname(). Thanks to John Hawkinson.

- Define "new" domain record types if not found in arpa/nameserv.h.
  Resulted from a suggestion from John Hawkinson (jhawk@mit.edu). Also
  fixed an endian bug when printing mx record and added some new record
  types.

- Added RIP V2 support. Thanks to Jeffrey Honig (jch@bsdi.com)

  exit with a bad status if there were problems.

- Bail if ip option length is <= 0. Resulted from a bug report from
  Darren Reed (darrenr@vitruvius.arbld.unimelb.edu.au).

  that the selected value was not used. Thanks to Pascal Hennequin
  (Pascal.Hennequin@hugo.int-evry.fr).

- Add a truncated packet test to print-nfs.c. Thanks to Pascal Hennequin.

- BYTEORDER -> BYTE_ORDER Thanks to Terry Kennedy (terry@spcvxa.spc.edu).

v3.0.3 Sun Oct  1 18:35:00 GMT 1995

- Although there never was a 3.0.3 release, the linux boys cleverly
  "released" one in late 1995.

v3.0.2 Thu Apr 20 21:28:16 PDT 1995

- Change configuration to not use gcc v2 flags with gcc v1.

- Redo gmt2local() so that it works under BSDI (which seems to return
  an empty timezone struct from gettimeofday()). Based on report from
  Terry Kennedy (terry@spcvxa.spc.edu).

- Change configure to recognize IP[0-9]* as "mips" SGI hardware. Based
  on report from Mark Andrews (mandrews@alias.com).

- Don't pass cc flags to gcc. Resulted from a bug report from Rainer
  Orth (ro@techfak.uni-bielefeld.de).

- Fixed printout of connection id for uncompressed tcp slip packets.
  Resulted from a bug report from Richard Stevens (rstevens@noao.edu).

- Hack around deficiency in Ultrix's make.

- Add ETHERTYPE_TRAIL define which is missing from irix5.

v3.0.1 Wed Aug 31 22:42:26 PDT 1994

- Fix problems with gcc2 vs. malloc() and read() prototypes under SunOS 4.

v3.0 Mon Jun 20 19:23:27 PDT 1994

- Added support for printing tcp option timestamps thanks to
  Mark Andrews (mandrews@alias.com).

- Reorganize protocol dumpers to take const pointers to packets so they
  never change the contents (i.e., they used to do endian conversions
  in place).  Previously, whenever more than one pass was taken over
  the packet, the packet contents would be dumped incorrectly (i.e.,
  the output form -x would be wrong on little endian machines because
  the protocol dumpers would modify the data).  Thanks to Charles Hannum
  (mycroft@gnu.ai.mit.edu) for reporting this problem.

- Added support for decnet protocol dumping thanks to Jeff Mogul
  (mogul@pa.dec.com).

- Fix bug that caused length of packet to be incorrectly printed
  (off by ether header size) for unknown ethernet types thanks
  to Greg Miller (gmiller@kayak.mitre.org).

- Added support for IPX protocol dumping thanks to Brad Parker
  (brad@fcr.com).

- Added check to verify IP header checksum under -v thanks to
  Brad Parker (brad@fcr.com).

- Move packet capture code to new libpcap library (which is
  packaged separately).

- Prototype everything and assume an ansi compiler.

- print-arp.c: Print hardware ethernet addresses if they're not
  what we expect.

- print-bootp.c: Decode the cmu vendor field. Add RFC1497 tags.
  Many helpful suggestions from Gordon Ross (gwr@jericho.mc.com).

- print-fddi.c: Improvements. Thanks to Jeffrey Mogul
  (mogul@pa.dec.com).

- print-icmp.c: Byte swap netmask before printing. Thanks to
  Richard Stevens (rstevens@noao.edu). Print icmp type when unknown.

- print-ip.c: Print the inner ip datagram of ip-in-ip encapsulated packets.
  By default, only the inner packet is dumped, appended with the token
  "(encap)".  Under -v, both the inner and output packets are dumped
  (on the same line).  Note that the filter applies to the original packet,
  not the encapsulated packet.  So if you run tcpdump on a net with an
  IP Multicast tunnel, you cannot filter out the datagrams using the
  conventional syntax.  (You can filter away all the ip-in-ip traffic
  with "not ip proto 4".)

- print-nfs.c: Keep pending rpc's in circular table. Add generic
  nfs header and remove os dependences. Thanks to Jeffrey Mogul.

- print-ospf.c: Improvements. Thanks to Jeffrey Mogul.

- tcpdump.c: Add -T flag allows interpretation of "vat", "wb", "rpc"
  (sunrpc) and rtp packets. Added "inbound" and "outbound" keywords
  Add && and || operators

v2.2.1 Tue Jun 6 17:57:22 PDT 1992

- Fix bug with -c flag.

v2.2 Fri May 22 17:19:41 PDT 1992

- savefile.c: Remove hack that shouldn't have been exported. Add
  truncate checks.

- Added the 'icmp' keyword.  For example, 'icmp[0] != 8 and icmp[0] != 0'
  matches non-echo/reply ICMP packets.

- Many improvements to filter code optimizer.

- Added 'multicast' keyword and extended the 'broadcast' keyword can now be
  so that protocol qualifications are allowed. For example, "ip broadcast"
  and "ether multicast" are valid filters.

- Added support for monitoring the loopback interface (i.e. 'tcpdump -i lo').
  Jeffrey Honig (jch@MITCHELL.CIT.CORNELL.EDU) contributed the kernel
  patches to netinet/if_loop.c.

- Added support for the Ungermann-Bass Ethernet on IBM/PC-RTs running AOS.
  Contact Jeffrey Honig (jch@MITCHELL.CIT.CORNELL.EDU) for the diffs.

- Added EGP and OSPF printers, thanks to Jeffrey Honig.

v2.1 Tue Jan 28 11:00:14 PST 1992

- Internal release (never publically exported).

v2.0.1 Sun Jan 26 21:10:10 PDT

- Various byte ordering fixes.

- Add truncation checks.

- inet.c: Support BSD style SIOCGIFCONF.

- nametoaddr.c: Handle multi addresses for single host.

- optimize.c: Rewritten.

- pcap-bpf.c: don't choke when we get ptraced. only set promiscuous
  for broadcast nets.

- print-atal.c: Fix an alignment bug (thanks to
  stanonik@nprdc.navy.mil) Add missing printf() argument.

- print-bootp.c: First attempt at decoding the vendor buffer.

- print-domain.c: Fix truncation checks.

- print-icmp.c: Calculate length of packets from the ip header.

- print-ip.c: Print frag id in decimal (so it's easier to match up
  with non-frags). Add support for ospf, egp and igmp.

- print-nfs.c: Lots of changes.

- print-ntp.c: Make some verbose output depend on -v.

- print-snmp.c: New version from John LoVerso.

- print-tcp.c: Print rfc1072 tcp options.

- tcpdump.c: Print "0x" prefix for %x formats. Always print 6 digits
  (microseconds) worth of precision. Fix uid bugs.

- A packet dumper has been added (thanks to Jeff Mogul of DECWRL).
  With this option, you can create an architecture independent binary
  trace file in real time, without the overhead of the packet printer.
  At a later time, the packets can be filtered (again) and printed.

- BSD is supported.  You must have BPF in your kernel.
  Since the filtering is now done in the kernel, fewer packets are
  dropped.  In fact, with BPF and the packet dumper option, a measly
  Sun 3/50 can keep up with a busy network.

- Compressed SLIP packets can now be dumped, provided you use our
  SLIP software and BPF.  These packets are dumped as any other IP
  packet; the compressed headers are dumped with the '-e' option.

- Machines with little-endian byte ordering are supported (thanks to
  Jeff Mogul).

- Ultrix 4.0 is supported (also thanks to Jeff Mogul).

- IBM RT and Stanford Enetfilter support has been added by
  Rayan Zachariassen <rayan@canet.ca>.  Tcpdump has been tested under
  both the vanilla Enetfilter interface, and the extended interface
  (#ifdef'd by IBMRTPC) present in the MERIT version of the Enetfilter.

- TFTP packets are now printed (requests only).

- BOOTP packets are now printed.

- SNMP packets are now printed. (thanks to John LoVerso of Xylogics).

- Sparc architectures, including the Sparcstation-1, are now
  supported thanks to Steve McCanne and Craig Leres.

- SunOS 4 is now supported thanks to Micky Liu of Columbia
  University (micky@cunixc.cc.columbia.edu).

- IP options are now printed.

- RIP packets are now printed.

- There's a -v flag that prints out more information than the
  default (e.g., it will enable printing of IP ttl, tos and id)
  and -q flag that prints out less (e.g., it will disable
  interpretation of AppleTalk-in-UDP).

- The grammar has undergone substantial changes (if you have an
  earlier version of tcpdump, you should re-read the manual
  entry).

  The most useful change is the addition of an expression
  syntax that lets you filter on arbitrary fields or values in the
  packet.  E.g., "ip[0] > 0x45" would print only packets with IP
  options, "tcp[13] & 3 != 0" would print only TCP SYN and FIN
  packets.

  The most painful change is that concatenation no longer means
  "and" -- e.g., you have to say "host foo and port bar" instead
  of "host foo port bar".  The up side to this down is that
  repeated qualifiers can be omitted, making most filter
  expressions shorter.  E.g., you can now say "ip host foo and
  (bar or baz)" to look at ip traffic between hosts foo and bar or
  between hosts foo and baz.  [The old way of saying this was "ip
  host foo and (ip host bar or ip host baz)".]

v2.0 Sun Jan 13 12:20:40 PST 1991

- Initial public release.
