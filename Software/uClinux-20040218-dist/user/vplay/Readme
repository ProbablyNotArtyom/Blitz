Digitized Audio Utility for Linux ver. 0.3
============================================

This directory contains vplay.c, a modified version of recplay.c.

vrec and vplay
--------------

These programs can be used for recording and playing:
  CREATIVE LABS VOICE files
  MICROSOFT WAVE file
  raw audio data. 

Both programs accept the same options:

	vrec	[-qvwrS] [-s speed] [-t seconds] -b bits [filename1 ...]
	vplay	[-qvwrS] [-s speed] [-t seconds] -b bits [filename1 ...]

	-S		Stereo (default is mono).
	-s speed	Sets the speed (default is 8 kHz). If the speed is
			less than 300, it will be multiplied by 1000.
	-t seconds	Sets the recording (or playback) time in seconds.
			(Default is no time limit).
	-t bits		Sets sample size (bits/sample). Possible values are
			8 and 16 (default 8).
        -v              record a CREATIVE LABS VOICE file (default)
        -w              record a MICROSOFT WAVE file
        -r              record raw data without header
        -q              quiet mode

        The options for speed, time etc. take only effect if you playing
        raw data files (or recording). VOC and WAVE-files include this
        information in their headers/internal structure.
	If no filenames are given, stdout (vrec) or stdin (vplay) is used. 
        The -t parameter applies to each files. For example

		vrec -r -t 1 a b c

	records one second of audio data to each of the files a, b, and c and

		vplay -t 1 a b c

	plays the first second of each of the files a, b and c (if its
        raw audio).

Don't use higher recording speeds than your card supports. This error is not
always detected by the driver.

vplay supports:
  - the full CREATIVE LABS VOICE structure:
    Silence, Repeat loops (on seekable input), Stereo, ASCII blocks,
    blocks with different sampling rate 
  - on non-stereo cards (SB 1.0 - 2.0) 8 bit stereo files will be
    played as mono (the first channel is used)
  - on non-16-bit cards, 16 bit WAVE files will be played as 8 bit
    (you can really play on a SB 1.0 a 16 bit stereo WAVE file, or
    buy ...)

unsupported:
  - packed VOC files (because /dev/dsp can't it (yet ?))
  - multi block WAVE files (if there exists like VOC files, my specs
    says no but RIFF definition yes ???)
  - not PCM coded WAVE files (because I don't know other methods)
  - more channel WAVE files (somebody has a quadrophonic sample?)
