The next bug report will receive number: 61.

48. I should get someone with an alpha to test diald out in that
    environment so I can get rid of type size assumptions.
    Before I do that I need to look through the code for any
    places where I use "int" or "long" and really mean u_int32_t.
    (Mostly this will be with IP addresses.)
    Simiarly, I should look for uses of short where I really want u_int16_t,
    or char where I want u_int8_t.

59. By the way, ip-up options inside a restrict does not seem to work.
    The last ip-up script is always chosen, no matter the time.
    [As designed, but this would be neat to be able to do...]

61.
