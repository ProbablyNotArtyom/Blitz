The following people have contributed to the development of diald,
by testing the code, pointing out areas in which diald could
be improved, contributing patches, and just asking questions.
I would like to thank them for their efforts.

I've probably left many people out of this list. For those
I've neglected please accept my apologies. Maybe someday
I'll manage to automate the process of collecting your
names from my mail archives!

I would also like to thank Alan Cox for the initial idea, which
lead to first a simple "proof of concept" shell script, and now
to the monstrous example of creeping featurism you have before you.
