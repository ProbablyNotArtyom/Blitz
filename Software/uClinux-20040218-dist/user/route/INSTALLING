net-tools

                               INSTALLING

Please read the file `README' before you start with the installation of the
net-tools.



HACKERS WAY
-----------
cd /usr/src ; tar xvzf net-tools*.tar.gz
less Makefile ; make config ; make ; make -n install ; make install



CONFIGURE
---------
First of all change into the net-tools directory.

Before you start with the Installation please have a look into the toplevel
Makefile. There are some configuration options with explanations.

To configure the compilation use "make config".

If you have a recent Kernel you can and SHOULD answer ALL the Configuration
Options with YES. You only have to decide about the NLS:

If you don't know whether GNU gettext is supported on your system or not, run
msgfmt.  If it exists, there is every chance that GNU gettext is
supported.


COMPILE
-------  
To compile simply use "make".

There should be no warnings or errors.



INSTALLATION
------------
If you want to install the binaries use "make install".

This will generate backups of your old binaries. If you dont want the
backups, please use "make update" instead. To change the default permissions
and ownerships of the installed binaries and manpages edit the Makefile. You
can test the Installation with "make -n install". This will tell make: Don't
run any commands, just print them.
