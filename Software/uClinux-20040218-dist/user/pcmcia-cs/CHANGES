-- Cleaned up header files.
-- Fixed pcmem_cs for 1.1.47.

Version 2.1.1
-- Fixed network setup bug in config.sample.

   devices for accessing PCMCIA card memory.
-- Moved cardmgr from /usr/sbin to /sbin.
-- Added 'sockets' parameter to i82365 for systems where the probe
   does not give the right answer.
-- Added support for memory windows to CS.
-- Working on support for IBM CCAE in de650_cs.c.
-- Changed ds.c to relay major and minor device #'s as well as device
   names; now cardmgr can create device files on the fly.
-- Changed tcic driver to support alternate base addresses for the
   TCIC-2 chip, via an 'insmod' parameter setting.
-- Moved all configuration options to 'make.options', cleaned up the
   Makefiles, so that builds will be warning-free.

-- Cleaned up event handling in CS to make insert/removal detection
   more robust -- seems to help with MHz XJ2144.
-- Fixed bug in cardmgr temporary device file unlinking that was
   causing /tmp to fill up with bogus device files.
-- Fixed cardmgr to log messages on the console when syslogd is not
   running.
-- No patches needed for 1.1.43 kernel!

-- Updated patches for 1.1.42 kernel.
-- Major file reorganization: now all the pcmcia stuff is segregated
   in one directory tree.
-- Changed device code in ds.c to grab the first free character
   device number.  Also changed cardmgr to read /proc/devices to
   determine what device number was found.  This eliminates the
   need for a kernel patch to include/linux/major.h.
-- Moved the "improved" resource registrar code out of ioport.c and
   into drivers/pcmcia, since it seems unlikely to be adopted any time
   soon.  
-- Changed DE650 driver so that it will pick I/O ports aligned to a 32
   port boundary between 0x300 and 0x400, since odd boundaries don't
   work.
-- Fixed IBM modem test in serial driver so it won't bail on modems
   with incomplete CIS's.
-- Working on simplifying configuration of 3c589 driver.  Now you can
   set if_port from insmod: "insmod 3c589_cs.o if_port=#".  This still
   isn't useful, because cardmgr doesn't allow arguments for modules.

[06-Aug-94] Version 1.7

   CIS.  This fixes Intel modems (and others??).

   card status changes on systems where card insertion/removal irq's
   don't seem to work.

-- Better card status change handling with TCIC-2 controller.
