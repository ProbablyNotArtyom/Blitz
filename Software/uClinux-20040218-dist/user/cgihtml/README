================================================

cgihtml is a collection of CGI parsing and HTML output functions
written in C.  These routines simplify the task of writing CGI
programs in C.

To install, untar the distribution in your cgi-src directory and
type 'make'.  Documentation is in docs/cgihtml.html.  More information
is available on the cgihtml home page at
     <URL:http://www.eekim.com/software/cgihtml/>

You can obtain a copy of cgihtml from:
     <URL:ftp://ftp.eekim.com/users/eekim/cgihtml/>

Subscribe to the cgihtml discussion list by sending e-mail to
majordomo@hcs.harvard.edu with the message:

For a simple example of how to use cgihtml, look at the source for
query-results.c.

Release Notes:
--------------
cgihtml and all accompanying source is hereby released to the public
domain.  Although I do not require it, I would appreciate attribution
if you use my code.

Support:
--------

While I try to support this package, I often do not have the time to
respond quickly to your questions and needs.  The best way to get
support is to subscribe to the cgihtml mailing list as described
above, and to send your questions to cgihtml@hcs.harvard.edu.
