---------------------------------------

  RAM consumption. It will eventually feature module
  support, as well as several convienence features that
  other shells do not have.

Author: Mooneer Salem (mooneer@earthlink.net),
   with most code taken from the book "Developing Linux
   Applications" (unsure of author, anyone have any ideas?)

Developer's build environment: Debian GNU/Linux 2.1

Installing: Read 'INSTALL' for more information

Change Log: See 'ChangeLog'

Credits: See 'AUTHORS'

News: See 'NEWS'

Other notes: On some systems, 'libreadline.so' doesn't exist,
   but 'libreadline.so.xx' does. If this is the case, do a
   "ln -s libreadline.so.xx libreadline.so" in the directory with
   libreadline.so.xx and attempt to recompile. Otherwise, you might not
   get readline support compiled in.
