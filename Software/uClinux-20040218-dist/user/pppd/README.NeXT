It is recommended that you use the PPP installer package to install
the latest version of PPP.  This installer package has been designed
to make installation of PPP exceedingly easy and includes all the
documentation you need.  However, if you want to manually compile and
configure PPP, the subdirectory 'NeXT' contains the documentation and
information you need.  You do NOT need to look at these files if you
use the installer package.
