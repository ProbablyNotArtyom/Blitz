pppoe: a PPP-over-Ethernet redirector for pppd
Copyright (C) 2000 Roaring Penguin Software Inc.

Much inspiration from an earlier client by Luke Stras.

The MSS clamping was inspired by mssclampfw by Marc Boucher <marc@mbsi.ca>
with acknowledgements to Rebel.com (http://www.rebel.com).  However, the
actual MSS clamping code is original and is licensed under the GPL, unlike
the original mssclampfw.

Introduction
============

pppoe is a user-space redirector which permits the use of PPPoE
(Point-to-Point Over Ethernet) with Linux.  PPPoE is used by many
ADSL service providers.

Installation
============

Requirements
------------

1) Linux 2.2.9 or later on Intel, Sparc or PowerPC.  It may work on
   Alpha, too -- anyone care to let me know?

	   OR

   Linux 2.0.36 or later.

	   OR

   FreeBSD, NetBSD or OpenBSD with BPF support.  I have access only
   to FreeBSD.  In general, I can't answer questions about the *BSD's
   as well as I can about Linux.


2) pppd 2.3.10 or later.  Versions 2.3.7 and later work unless you use
   demand-dialling.  For demand dialling, you *must* use 2.3.10 or later.

QUICKSTART
----------

If you're very lucky, the "quickstart" method will work.  After unpacking
the archive, become root and type:

	./go

This should configure, compile and install the software and set up your
ADSL connection.  You'll have to answer a few questions along the way.

If that didn't work, read the rest of this README.

Compiling
---------

Compile and install pppd if you don't already have it.  Then:

1) Unpack:

$ tar xzvf rp-pppoe-xxx.tar.gz

2) Configure:

$ ./configure

3) Compile:

$ make

4) Install (this step must be done as root)

# make install

5) Now read HOW-TO-CONNECT
