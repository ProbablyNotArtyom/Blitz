.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an interactive file transfer program, similar to
.Xr ftp 1 ,
which performs all operations over an encrypted
.Xr ssh 1
transport.
It may also use many features of ssh, such as public key authentication and
compression.
.Nm
connects and logs into the specified
.Ar host ,
then enters an interactive command mode.
.Pp
The second usage format will retrieve files automatically if a non-interactive
authentication method is used; otherwise it will do so after
successful interactive authentication.
.Pp
The third usage format allows the sftp client to start in a remote directory.
.Pp
The final usage format allows for automated sessions using the
.Fl b
option.
In such cases, it is usually necessary to configure public key authentication
to obviate the need to enter a password at connection time (see
.Xr sshd 8
and
.Xr ssh-keygen 1
for details).
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b Ar batchfile
Batch mode reads a series of commands from an input
.Ar batchfile
instead of
.Em stdin .
Since it lacks user interaction it should be used in conjunction with
non-interactive authentication.
.Nm
will abort if any of the following
commands fail:
.Ic get , put , rename , ln ,
.Ic rm , mkdir , chdir , ls ,
.Ic lchdir , chmod , chown , chgrp , lpwd
and
.Ic lmkdir .
Termination on error can be suppressed on a command by command basis by
prefixing the command with a
.Sq Ic \-
character (for example,
.Ic -rm /tmp/blah* ) .
.It Fl o Ar ssh_option
Can be used to pass options to
.Nm ssh
in the format used in
.Xr ssh_config 5 .
This is useful for specifying options
for which there is no separate
.Nm sftp
command-line flag.
For example, to specify an alternate port use:
.Ic sftp -oPort=24 .
.It Fl s Ar subsystem | sftp_server
Specifies the SSH2 subsystem or the path for an sftp server
on the remote host.
A path is useful for using
.Nm
over protocol version 1, or when the remote
.Xr sshd 8
does not have an sftp subsystem configured.
.It Fl v
Raise logging level.
This option is also passed to ssh.
.It Fl B Ar buffer_size
Specify the size of the buffer that
.Nm
uses when transferring files.
Larger buffers require fewer round trips at the cost of higher
memory consumption.
The default is 32768 bytes.
.It Fl C
Enables compression (via ssh's
.Fl C
flag).
.It Fl F Ar ssh_config
Specifies an alternative
per-user configuration file for
.Xr ssh 1 .
This option is directly passed to
.Xr ssh 1 .
.It Fl P Ar sftp_server path
Connect directly to a local sftp server
(rather than via
.Xr ssh 1 )
This option may be useful in debugging the client and server.
.It Fl R Ar num_requests
Specify how many requests may be outstanding at any one time.
Increasing this may slightly improve file transfer speed
but will increase memory usage.
The default is 16 outstanding requests.
.It Fl S Ar program
Name of the
.Ar program
to use for the encrypted connection.
The program must understand
.Xr ssh 1
options.
.It Fl 1
Specify the use of protocol version 1.
.El
.Sh INTERACTIVE COMMANDS
Once in interactive mode,
.Nm
understands a set of commands similar to those of
.Xr ftp 1 .
Commands are case insensitive and pathnames may be enclosed in quotes if they
contain spaces.
