  NOTE: The CVS repository for NTP is inactive.  NTP is now maintained
  using BitKeeper; see README.bk for more info.

To get the NTP distribution via anonymous CVS:

    % cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@www.ntp.org:/cvs/ntp login

the password is: anoncvs

    % rm -rf ntp
    % cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@www.ntp.org:/cvs/ntp co ntp

after which the "ntp_update" script in the top-level of the tree should
keep things in synch and properly timestamped.

PLEASE NOTE:

	When obtaining the NTP distribution directly via CVS instead of
	using "ntp_update", the files are installed in an arbitrary
	order.

	When you run "make", this may cause some of the generated files
	to be reconstructed.

	If you do not have the right verison of automake and autoconf,
	these files will be regenerated incorrectly.

	In this case, you can "fix" your distribution by running:

			     ntp_update -C

	which will force any local changes to your NTP files to be
	discarded and replaced with the versions in the repository.

	If "ntp_update -C" does not work  just remove the "broken"
	files (probably Makefile.in files) and re-run ntp_udate.

There are some mailing lists for the NTP CVS distribution.  For more
information, send a message to <majordomo@ntp.org> with the word "lists"
in the body of the message.

If you get NTP via CVS, you MAY need to build the release using GNU make
and gcc.

You can then "make dist" to build a release tarball that does not require
GNU make or gcc.

The reason GNU make and gcc may be required is because the repository
version of NTP does not have the make dependencies built-in.  These
dependencies are created dynamically, and this dynamic process may
require GNU make and gcc.

I'm told that the version of automake we are now using does not require
GNU make or gcc for the dependency tracking, but I haven't tested this
yet.
