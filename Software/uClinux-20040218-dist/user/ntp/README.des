If you want DES support in ntp:

- Use MD5 instead:
- - convert your DES keys to MD5 by changing the 'A', 'N' or 'S' to 'M'

If you *need* DES support:

- first see if you can simply "want" DES support instead
- Follow the instructions in README.rsa

Be advised that the RSA DES code is not quite as portable as one might
wish for.  In particular, DES under NTP will only work between machines
of the same "endianness".

Dave would prefer that new/alternative encryption schemes follow the
RSA API.
