net-tools

                               INSTALLING

Please read the file `README' before you start with the installation of the
net-tools.



HACKERS WAY
-----------
cd /usr/src ; tar xvzf net-tools*.tar.gz
less Makefile ; make config ; make ; make -n install ; make install



CONFIGURE
---------
First of all change into the net-tools directory.

Before you start with the Installation please have a look into the toplevel
Makefile. There are some configuration options with explanations.

To configure the compilation use "make config".  The default answers should
be safe for all configurations.  If you have kernel 2.2 and glibc 2.1 most
of the other options should work as well.


COMPILE
-------  
To compile simply use "make".

There should be no warnings or errors.



INSTALLATION
------------
If you want to install the binaries use "make install".

This will generate backups of your old binaries. If you dont want the
backups, please use "make update" instead. To change the default permissions
and ownerships of the installed binaries and manpages edit the Makefile. You
can test the Installation with "make -n install". This will tell make: Don't
run any commands, just print them.
