I would like to thank the following people and organizations:

  o Takashi Manabe taught me how to transmit raw ethernet frames on
    Linux. He also gave me suggestions about which options should be
    supported.

  o Ted Lemon gave me the detail information of dhcpd-BETA-5.13

  o The following people tested dhcpcd to various DHCP server
    implementations: Koji OKAMURA, Hisaaki Shibata, N. Komazaki,
    Hideto Sazuka, and Kenji Kajiwara.

  o The following people reported and/or fixed bugs: Koji Okamura, Dan
    Halbert, Brandon Mitchell, N. Komazaki, Ulrich Windl, Andrew
    Kieschnick, and David Filiatrault (See the file 'Changes' for more
    details)

  o FORE Systems (aka, Alantec) for the use of equipment, after hours
    of course ;-)
