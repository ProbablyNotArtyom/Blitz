This is BSD 4.4 routed from NetBSD-current (as of 10-Jul-1995)
ported back to Linux.

It runs under Linux 1.2.x and Linux 1.3.9 and higher.

The port was done by Miquel van Smoorenburg, miquels@cistron.nl

It was cleanly ANSIfied and merged into NetKit 9 by Alan Cox. I also
added the lusertrap. Vendors please see startup.c for how to ship the
initial /etc/gateways. Added fixes to the length assumption bug and 
ANSIfying found some other cockups in the code.

first attempt at security fixups by making the root owned file exploit a nobody
problem
Seems the best solution for the moment though I guess alans idea of streamingg
it all to syslog makes for more sanity although that is an unreliable mechanism
and it's quite possible important trace information could be lost
