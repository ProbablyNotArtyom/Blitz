21.08.2000
	- released 0.6.6
	- vidcat: added verbose switch
	- w3camd: minor changes to get it working without mmap(), e.g.
		video loopback from motion
		but w3camd is still a buggy dirty hack :-)

16.07.2000
	- w3cam.c: added new config file parameter: device
	- w3cam.c: minor changes in usage()
	- font.c: some changes to unsigned int/char * to get
	  ASCII > 127 in timestamps working

20.05.2000
	- w3camd/w3jpeg.c: don't use ERREXIT() so i can handle sig pipes

01.05.2000
	- vidcat.c: set width/height for devices which don't support
	  mmap()

	- released 0.6.5
	- w3cam.c: changed perror() to log2()

	- fixed memory leak in vidcat.c:put_image_jpeg()

22.01.2000
	- released 0.6.4

21.01.2000
	- released 0.6.3
	- w3cam.c: fixed memory leak in put_image_png()

28.11.1998
	- added w3camd/ directory with a simple daemon

27.11.1998
	- renamed vcat to vidcat, cause there is still an other tools
	  which is named vcat

16.11.1998
	- w3cam.c: do not close/open if refresh time == 0.0
	- w3cam.c: changed quality_default to from 75 to 65
	- w3cam.c: changed wait loop for open device to 1/4 second / 20 times
	- w3cam.c: changed "refresh" to float value

15.11.1998
	- vcat.c: added loop option "-l" (does it make sense?, piping to xli
	  doesn't work:()
	- w3cam.c,vcat.c: added "cjpeg.dct_method = JDCT_FASTEST;"

13.11.1998
	- added "freqlist" to the config file

12.11.1998
	- added option "freq" to set frequenzy for tuner, set to "0" if

	  inputs at the same time :)

	- changed w3cam.c and w3cam.css to introduce a class "image"

	  so no one could set a short refresh time to overload your system.

	- released version 0.4

	- changed get_image() to mute audio (Chris Dornfeld and Mat Withers
	  wanted this feature) nevertheless there is a little bit sound
	  for some milisecs cause there is time between opening the device
	  and setting the device to mute :(

	- changed get_image(): introduced new option (usleep) for sleeping
	  some micro seconds before capturing, cause Mat Withers said his
	  intel card needs it to adjust it's brightness level..
	  set USEC_DEFAULT in w3cam.c to e.g. 500000 to sleep half a second

	- started ChangeLog
