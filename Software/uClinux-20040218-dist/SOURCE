uClinux/distribution SOURCE
---------------------------

The sources in this build have come from many places. Everything in
this package is covered by some type of open source or public domain
license. GNU copyleft is the most prevelant, but check within each
package for its specific licsense if you have concerns.


The directories:

linux-2.0.x -- uClinux sources from cvs.uclinux.org
linux-2.4.x -- uClinux sources from cvs.uclinux.org
linux-2.6.x -- uClinux sources from cvs.uclinux.org

freeswan    -- FreeSWAN 1.97 from www.freeswan.org

lib         -- Application libraries. Includes uC-libc, libm and others.

uClibc      -- An alternate libc from www.uClibc.org

glibc       -- Standard GNU libc

user        -- User mode applications, source from many, many places.
               Too many places to enumerate, most are standard GNU/Linux
               packages, all are freely available on the net somewhere.
               Some applications have been specially developed for uClinux.

The following directories hold results of the build process:

config      -- A version of the linux config scripts that are used to
               drive the vendor/platform configuration.

vendors     -- holds plaform specific build information or support files.
               This is also the location where default build configurations
               are kept for each of the supported platforms.

romfs       -- Is the structrue of the root file system. Mostly it holds
               the user application binaries, but also has device nodes,
               configuration files, shared libraries, etc.

images      -- Contains the final build binaries of the kernel, root file
               system, and often a complete combined image.
