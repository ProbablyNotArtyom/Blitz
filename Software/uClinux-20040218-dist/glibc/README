This directory contains the version 2.2.5 release of the GNU C Library.
Many bugs have been fixed since the last release.
Some bugs surely remain.

As of this release, the GNU C library is known to run on the following
configurations:

		*-*-gnu			GNU Hurd
		i[3456]86-*-linux-gnu	Linux-2.x on Intel
		m68k-*-linux-gnu	Linux-2.x on Motorola 680x0
		alpha*-*-linux-gnu	Linux-2.x on DEC Alpha
		powerpc-*-linux-gnu     Linux and MkLinux on PowerPC systems
		sparc-*-linux-gnu	Linux-2.x on SPARC
		sparc64-*-linux-gnu	Linux-2.x on UltraSPARC 64-bit
		arm-*-none		ARM standalone systems
		arm-*-linux		Linux-2.x on ARM
		arm-*-linuxaout		Linux-2.x on ARM using a.out binaries
		mips*-*-linux-gnu	Linux-2.x on MIPS
		ia64-*-linux-gnu	Linux-2.x on ia64
		s390-*-linux-gnu	Linux-2.x on IBM S/390
		s390x-*-linux-gnu	Linux-2.x on IBM S/390 64-bit
		sh-*-linux-gnu		Linux-2.x on Super Hitachi
		cris-*-linux-gnu	Linux-2.4+ on CRIS

Former releases of this library (version 1.09.1 and perhaps earlier
versions) used to run on the following configurations:

		alpha-dec-osf1
		i[3456]86-*-bsd4.3
		i[3456]86-*-isc2.2
		i[3456]86-*-isc3
		i[3456]86-*-sco3.2
		i[3456]86-*-sco3.2v4
		i[3456]86-*-sysv
		i[3456]86-*-sysv4
		i[3456]86-force_cpu386-none
		i[3456]86-sequent-bsd
		i960-nindy960-none
		m68k-hp-bsd4.3
		m68k-mvme135-none
		m68k-mvme136-none
		m68k-sony-newsos3
		m68k-sony-newsos4
		m68k-sun-sunos4
		mips-dec-ultrix4
		mips-sgi-irix4
		sparc-sun-solaris2
		sparc-sun-sunos4

Since no one has volunteered to test and fix the above configurations,
these are not supported at the moment.  It's expected that these don't
work anymore.  Porting the library is not hard.  If you are interested
in doing a port, please contact the glibc maintainers by sending
electronic mail to <bug-glibc@gnu.org>.

There are some add-ons which can be used together with GNU libc.  They
are designed in a way to ease the installation by integrating them in
the libc source tree.  Simply get the add-ons you need and use the
--enable-add-ons option of the `configure' script to tell where the
add-ons are found.  Please read the FAQ file for more details.

See the file INSTALL to find out how to configure, build, install, and port
the GNU C library.  You might also consider reading the WWW pages for the
GNU libc at http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/libc.html.

The GNU C Library is completely documented by the Texinfo manual found
in the `manual/' subdirectory.  The manual is still being updated and
contains some known errors and omissions; we regret that we do not
have the resources to work on the manual as much as we would like.
Please send comments on the manual to <bug-glibc-manual@gnu.org>, and
not to the library bug-reporting address.

The file NOTES contains a description of the feature-test macros used
in the GNU C library, explaining how you can tell the library what
facilities you want it to make available.

We prefer to get bug reports sent using the `glibcbug' shell script which
is installed together with the rest of the GNU libc to <bugs@gnu.org>.
Simply run this shell script and fill in the information.  Nevertheless
you can still send bug reports to <bug-glibc@gnu.org> as normal electronic
mails.

The GNU C Library is free software.  See the file COPYING.LIB for copying
conditions.
