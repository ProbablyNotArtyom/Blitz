%description
The C language provides no built-in facilities for performing such
common operations as input/output, memory management, string
manipulation, and the like.  Instead, these facilities are defined in
a standard library, which you compile and link with your programs. The
GNU C library (this package) defines all of the library functions that
are specified by the ISO C standard, as well as additional features
specific to POSIX and other derivatives of the Unix operating system,
and extensions specific to the GNU system.
