	 * unexpected results.
	 *
	 * _res.options is tricky since some apps were known to diddle the bits
	 * before res_init() was first called. We can't replicate that semantic
	 * with dynamic initialization (they may have turned bits off that are
	 * set in RES_DEFAULT).  Our solution is to declare such applications
	 * "broken".  They could fool us by setting RES_INIT but none do (yet).
