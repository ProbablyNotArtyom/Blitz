Dynamic Audio Power Management for Portable Devices
===================================================

Description
===========

Dynamic Audio Power Management (DAPM) is designed to allow portable
Linux devices to use the minimum amount of power within the audio
subsystem at all times. It is independent of other kernel PM and as
such, can easily co-exist with the other PM systems.

DAPM is also completely transparent to all user space applications as
all power switching is done within the ASoC core. No code changes or
recompiling are required for user space applications. DAPM makes power
switching decisions based upon any audio stream (capture/playback)
activity and audio mixer settings within the device.

DAPM spans the whole machine. It covers power control within the entire
audio subsystem, this includes internal codec power blocks and machine
