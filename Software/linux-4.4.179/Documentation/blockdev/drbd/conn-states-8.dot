ASoC Codec Class Driver
=======================

The codec class driver is generic and hardware independent code that configures
the codec, FM, MODEM, BT or external DSP to provide audio capture and playback.
It should contain no code that is specific to the target platform or machine.
All platform and machine specific code should be added to the platform and
machine drivers respectively.

Each codec class driver *must* provide the following features:-

1. Codec DAI and PCM configuration
2. Codec control IO - using RegMap API
3. Mixers and audio controls
4. Codec audio operations
5. DAPM description.
6. DAPM event handler.

Optionally, codec drivers can also provide:-

7. DAC Digital mute control.

Its probably best to use this guide in conjunction with the existing codec
driver code in sound/soc/c
