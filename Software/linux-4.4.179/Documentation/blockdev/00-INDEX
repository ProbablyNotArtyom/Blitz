HD-Audio DP-MST Support
=======================

To support DP MST audio, HD Audio hdmi codec driver introduces virtual pin
and dynamic pcm assignment.

Virtual pin is an extension of per_pin. The most difference of DP MST
from legacy is that DP MST introduces device entry. Each pin can contain
several device entries. Each device entry behaves as a pin.

As each pin may contain several device entries and each codec may contain
several pins, if we use one pcm per per_pin, there will be many PCMs.
The new solution is to create a few PCMs and to dynamical
