Kernel driver nouveau
===================

Supported chips:
* NV43+

Authors: Martin Peres (mupuf) <martin.peres@free.fr>

Description
---------

This driver allows to read the GPU core temperature, drive the GPU fan and
set temperature alarms.

Currently, due to the absence of in-kernel API to access HWMON drivers, Nouveau
cannot access any of the i2c external monitoring chips it may find. If you
have one of those, temperature and/or fan management through Nouveau's HWMON
interface is likely not to work. This document may then not cover your situation
entirely.

Temperature management
--------------------

Temperature is exposed under as a read-only HWMON attribute temp1_input.

In order to protect the GPU from overheating, Nouveau supports 4 configurable
temperature thresholds:

 * Fan_boost: Fan speed is set to 100% when reaching this temperature;
 * Downclock: The GPU will be downclocked to reduce its power dissipation;
 * Critical:
