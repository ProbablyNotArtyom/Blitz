 * vineetg: May 2011
 *  -Folded PAGE_PRESENT (used by VM) and PAGE_VALID (used by MMU) into 1.
 *     They are semantically the same although in different contexts
 *     VALID marks a TLB entry exists and it will only happen if PRESENT
 *  - Utilise some unused free bits to confine PTE flags to 12 bits
 *     This is a must for 4k pg-sz
 *
 * vineetg: Mar 2011 - changes to accommodate MMU TLB Page Descriptor mods
 *  -TLB Locking never really existed, except for initial specs
 *  -SILENT_xxx not needed for our port
 *  -Per my request, MMU V3 changes the layout of some of the bits
 *     to avoid a few shifts in TLB Miss handlers.
 *
 * vineetg: April 2010
 *  -PGD entry no longer contains any flags. If empty it is 0, otherwise has
 *   Pg-Tbl ptr. Thus pmd_present(), pmd_valid(), pmd_set( ) become simpler
 *
 * vineetg: April 2010
 *  -Switched form 8:11:13 split for page table lookup to 11:8:13
 *  -this speeds up page table allocation itself as we now have to memset 1K
 *    instead of 8k per page table.
 * -TODO: Right
