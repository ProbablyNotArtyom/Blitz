/*
 * Normal Math for computing loops in "N" usecs
 *  -we have precomputed @loops_per_jiffy
 *  -1 sec has HZ jiffies
 * loops per "N" usecs = ((loops_per_jiffy * HZ / 1000000) * N)
 *
 * Approximate Division by multiplication:
 *  -Mathematically if we multiply and divide a number by same value the
 *   result remains unchanged:  In this case, we use 2^32
 *  -> (loops_per_N_usec * 2^32 ) / 2^32
 *  -> (((loops_per_jiffy * HZ / 1000000) * N) * 2^32) / 2^32
 *  -> (loops_per_jiffy * HZ * N * 4295) / 2^32
 *
 *  -Divide by 2^32 is very simply right shift by 32
 *  -We simply need to ensure that the multiply per above eqn happens in
 *   64-bit precision (if CPU doesn't support it - gcc can emaulate it)
