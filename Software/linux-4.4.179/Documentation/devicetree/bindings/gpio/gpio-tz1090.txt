/*		ARC700 ASID Management
 *
 * ARC MMU provides 8-bit ASID (0..255) to TAG TLB entries, allowing entries
 * with same vaddr (different tasks) to co-exit. This provides for
 * "Fast Context Switch" i.e. no TLB flush on ctxt-switch
 *
 * Linux assigns each task a unique ASID. A simple round-robin allocation
 * of H/w ASID is done using software tracker @asid_cpu.
 * When it reaches max 255, the allocation cycle starts afresh by flushing
 * the entire TLB and wrapping ASID back to zero.
 *
 * A new allocation cycle, post rollover, could potentially reassign an ASID
 * to a different task. Thus the rule is to refresh the ASID in a new cycle.
 * The 32 bit @asid_cpu (and mm->asid) have 8 bits MMU PID and rest 24 bits
 * serve as cycle/generation indicator and natural 32 bit unsigned math
 * automagically increments the generation when lower 8 bits rollover.
