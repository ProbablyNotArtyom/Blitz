 * The original linux ioctl numbering scheme was just a general
 * "anything goes" setup, where more or less random numbers were
 * assigned.  Sorry, I was clueless when I started out on this.
 *
 * On the alpha, we'll try to clean it up a bit, using a more sane
 * ioctl numbering, and also trying to be compatible with OSF/1 in
 * the process. I'd like to clean it up for the i386 as well, but
 * it's so painful recognizing both the new and the old numbers..
