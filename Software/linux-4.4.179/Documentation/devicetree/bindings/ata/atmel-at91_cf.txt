We Have Atomic Operation Control (ATOMCTL) Register.
This register determines the effect of using a S32C1I instruction
with various combinations of:

     1. With and without an Coherent Cache Controller which
        can do Atomic Transactions to the memory internally.

     2. With and without An Intelligent Memory Controller which
        can do Atomic Transactions itself.

The Core comes up with a default value of for the three types of cache ops:

      0x28: (WB: Internal, WT: Internal, BY:Exception)

On the FPGA Cards we
