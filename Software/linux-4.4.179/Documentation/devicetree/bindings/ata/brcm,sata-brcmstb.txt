MMUv3 initialization sequence.

The code in the initialize_mmu macro sets up MMUv3 memory mapping
identically to MMUv2 fixed memory mapping. Depending on
CONFIG_INITIALIZE_XTENSA_MMU_INSIDE_VMLINUX symbol this code is
located in addresses it was linked for (symbol undefined), or not
(symbol defined), so it needs to be position-independent.

The code has the following assumptions:
  This code fragment is run only on an MMU v3.
  TLBs are in their reset state.
  ITLBCFG and DTLBCFG are zero (reset state).
  RASID is 0x04030201 (reset state).
  PS.RING is zero (reset state).
  LITBASE is zero (reset state, PC-relative literals); required to be PIC.

TLB setup proceeds along the following steps.

  Legend:
    VA = virtual address (two upper nibbles of it);
    PA = physical address (two upper nibbles of it);
    pc = physical range that contains this code;
