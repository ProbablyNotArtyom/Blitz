Prerequisites
-------------
Versions of the gadget serial driver are available for the
2.4 Linux kernels, but this document assumes you are using
version 2.3 or later of the gadget serial driver in a 2.6
Linux kernel.

This document assumes that you are familiar with Linux and
Windows and know how to configure and build Linux kernels, run
standard utilities, use minicom and HyperTerminal, and work with
USB and serial devices.  It also assumes you configure the Linux
gadget and usb drivers as modules.

With version 2.3 of the driver, major and minor device nodes are
no longer statically defined.  Your Linux based system should mount
sysfs in /sys, and use "mdev" (in Busybox) or "udev" to make the
/dev nodes matching the sysfs /sys/class/tty files.



Overview
--------
The gadget serial driver is a Linux USB gadget driver, a USB device
side driver.  It runs on a Linux system that has USB device side
hardware; for example, a PDA, an embedded Linux system, or a PC
with a USB development card.

The gadget serial driver talks over USB to either a CDC ACM driver
or a generic USB serial driver running on a host PC.

   --------------------------------------

On the device-side Linux system, the gadget serial driver looks
like a serial device.

On the host-side system, the gadget serial device looks like a
CDC ACM compliant class device or a simple vendor specific device
with bulk in and bulk out endpoints, and it is treated similarly
to other serial devices.

The host side driver can potentially be any ACM compliant driver
or any driver that can talk to a device with a simple bulk in/out
interface.  Gadget serial has been tested with the Linux ACM driver,
the Windows usbser.sys ACM driver, and the Linux USB generic serial
driver.

With the gadget serial driver and the host side ACM or generic
serial driver running, you should be able to communicate between
the host and the gadget side systems as if they were connected by a
serial cable.

The gadget serial driver only provides simple unreliable data
communication.  It does not yet handle flow control or many other
features of normal serial devices.


Installing the Gadget Serial Driver
-----------------------------------
To use the gadget serial driver you must configure the Linux gadget
side kernel for "Support for USB Gadgets", for a "USB Peripheral
Controller" (for example, net2280), and for the "Serial Gadget"
