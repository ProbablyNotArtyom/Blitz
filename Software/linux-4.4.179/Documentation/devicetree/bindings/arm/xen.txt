MPIC interrupt controller
=========================

Device types supported:
  KVM_DEV_TYPE_FSL_MPIC_20     Freescale MPIC v2.0
  KVM_DEV_TYPE_FSL_MPIC_42     Freescale MPIC v4.2

Only one MPIC instance, of any type, may be instantiated.  The created
MPIC will act as the system interrupt controller, connecting to each
vcpu's interrupt inputs.

Groups:
  KVM_DEV_MPIC_GRP_MISC
  Attributes:
    KVM_DEV_MPIC_BASE_ADDR (rw, 64-bit)
      Base address of the 256 KiB MPIC register space.  Must be
      naturally aligned.  A value of zero disables the mapping.
      Reset value is zero.

  KVM_DEV_MPIC_GRP_REGISTER (rw, 32-bit)
    Access an MPIC register, as if the access were made from the guest.
    "attr" is the byte offset into the MPIC register space.  Accesses
    must be 4-byte aligned.
