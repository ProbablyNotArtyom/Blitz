KVM-specific MSRs.

=====================================================

KVM makes use of some custom MSRs to service some requests.

Custom MSRs have a range reserved for them, that goes from
0x4b564d00 to 0x4b564dff. There are MSRs outside this area,
but they are deprecated and their use is discouraged.
