Description
-----------

The DS2413 chip has two open-drain outputs (PIO A and PIO B).
Support is provided through the sysfs files "output" and "state".

Reading state
-------------
The "state" file provides one-byte value which is in the same format as for
the chip PIO_ACCESS_READ command (refer the datasheet for details):

Bit 0:   PIOA Pin State
Bit 1:   PIOA Output Latch State
Bit 2:   PIOB Pin State
Bit 3:   PIOB Output Latch State
Bit 4-7: Complement of Bit 3 to Bit 0 (verified by the kernel module)

This file is readonly.

Writing output
--------------
You can set the PIO pins using the "output" file.
It is writable, yo
