ARM Virtual Generic Interrupt Controller v3 and later (VGICv3)
==============================================================


Device types supported:
  KVM_DEV_TYPE_ARM_VGIC_V3     ARM Generic Interrupt Controller v3.0

Only one VGIC instance may be instantiated through this API.  The created VGIC
will act as the VM interrupt controller, requiring emulated user-space devices
to inject interrupts to the VGIC instead of directly to CPUs.  It is not
possible to create both a GICv3 and GICv2 on the same VM.

Creating a guest GICv3 device requires a host GICv3 as well.


Groups:
  KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_GRP_ADDR
  Attributes:
    KVM_VGIC_V3_ADDR_TYPE_DIST (rw, 64-bit)
      Base address in the guest physical address space of the GICv3 distributor
      register mappings. Only valid for KVM_DEV_TYPE_ARM_VGIC_V3.
      This address needs to be 64K aligned and the region covers 64 KByte.

    KVM_VGIC_V3_ADDR_TYPE_REDIST (rw, 64-bit)
      Base address in the guest physical address space of the GICv3
      redistributor register mappings. There are two 64K pages for each
      VCPU and all of the redistributor pages are contiguous.
      Only valid for KVM_DEV_TYPE_ARM_VGIC_V3.
      This address needs to be 64K aligned.

    KVM_VGIC_V3_ADDR_TYPE_REDIST_REGION (rw, 64-bit)
      The attribute data pointed to by kvm_device_attr.addr is a __u64 value:
      bits:     | 63   ....  52  |  51   ....   16 | 15 - 12  |11 - 0
      values:   |     count      |       base      |  flags   | index
      - index encodes the unique redistributor region index
      - flags: reserved for future use, currently 0
      - base field encodes bits [51:16] of the guest physical base address
        of the first redistributor in the region.
      - count encodes the number of redistributors in the region. Must be
        greater than 0.
      There are two 64K pages for each redistributor in the region and
      redistributors are laid out contiguously within the region. Regions
      are filled with redistributors in the index order. The sum of all
      region count fields must be greater than or equal to the number of
      VCPUs. Redistributor regions must be registered in the incremental
      index order, starting from index 0.
      The characteristics of a specific redistributor region can be read
      by presetting the index field in the attr data.
      Only valid for KVM_DEV_TYPE_ARM_VGIC_V3.

  It is invalid to mix calls with KVM_VGIC_V3_ADDR_TYPE_REDIST and
  KVM_VGIC_V3_ADDR_TYPE_REDIST_REGION attributes.

  Errors:
    -E2BIG:  Address outside of addressable IPA range
    -EINVAL: Incorrectly aligned address, bad redistributor region
             count/index, mixed redistributor region attribute usage
    -EEXIST: Address already configured
    -ENOENT: Attempt to read the characteristics of a non existing
             redistributor region
    -ENXIO:  The group or attribute is unknown/unsupported for this device
             or hardware support is missing.
    -EFAULT: Invalid user pointer for attr->addr.


  KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_GRP_DIST_REGS
  KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_GRP_REDIST_REGS
  Attributes:
    The attr field of kvm_device_attr encodes two values:
    bits:     | 63   ....  32  |  31   ....    0 |
    values:   |      mpidr     |      offset     |

    All distributor regs are (rw, 32-bit) and kvm_device_attr.addr points to a
    __u32 value.  64-bit registers must be accessed by separately accessing the
    lower and higher word.

    Writes to read-only registers are ignored by the kernel.

    KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_GRP_DIST_REGS accesses the main distributor registers.
    KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_GRP_REDIST_REGS accesses the redistributor of the CPU
    specified by the mpidr.

    The offset is relative to the "[Re]Distributor base address" as defined
    in the GICv3/4 specs.  Getting or setting such a register has the same
    effect as reading or writing the register on real hardware, except for the
    following registers: GICD_STATUSR, GICR_STATUSR, GICD_ISPENDR,
    GICR_ISPENDR0, GICD_ICPENDR, and GICR_ICPENDR0.  These registers behave
    differently when accessed via this interface compared to their
    architecturally defined behavior to allow software a full view of the
    VGIC's internal state.

    The mpidr field is used to specify which
    redistributor is accessed.  The mpidr is ignored for the distributor.

    The mpidr encoding is based on the affinity information in the
    architecture defined MPIDR, and the field is encoded as follows:
      | 63 .... 56 | 55 .... 48 | 47 .... 40 | 39 .... 32 |
      |    Aff3    |    Aff2    |    Aff1    |    Aff0    |

    Note that distributor fields are not banked, but return the same value
    regardless of the mpidr used to access the register.

    GICD_IIDR.Revision is updated when the KVM implementation is changed in a
    way directly observable by the guest or userspace.  Userspace should read
    GICD_IIDR from KVM and write back the read value to confirm its expected
    behavior is aligned with the KVM implementation.  Userspace should set
    GICD_IIDR before setting any other registers to ensure the expected
    behavior.


    The GICD_STATUSR and GICR_STATUSR registers are architecturally defined such
    that a write of a clear bit has no effect, whereas a write with a set bit
    clears that value.  To allow userspace to freely set the values of these two
    registers, setting the attributes with the register offsets for these two
    registers simply sets the non-reserved bits to the value written.


    Accesses (reads and writes) to the GICD_ISPENDR register region and
    GICR_ISPENDR0 registers get/set the value of the latched pending state for
    the interrupts.

    This is identical to the value returned by a guest read from ISPENDR for an
    edge triggered interrupt, but may differ for level triggered interrupts.
    For edge triggered interrupts, once an interrupt becomes pending (whether
    because of an edge detected on the input line or because of a guest write
    to ISPENDR) this state is "latched", and only cleared when either the
    interrupt is activated or when the guest writes to ICPENDR. A level
    triggered interrupt may be pending either because the level input is held
    high by a device, or because of a guest write to the ISPENDR register. Only
    ISPENDR writes are latched; if the device lowers the line level then the
    interrupt is no longer pending unless the guest also wrote to ISPENDR, and
    conversely writes to ICPENDR or activations of the interrupt do not clear
    the pending status if the line level is still being held high.  (These
    rules are documented in the GICv3 specification descriptions of the ICPENDR
    and ISPENDR registers.) For a level triggered interrupt the value accessed
    here is that of the latch which is set by ISPENDR and cleared by ICPENDR or
    interrupt activation, whereas the value returned by a guest read from
    ISPENDR is the logical OR of the latch value and the input line level.

    Raw access to the latch state is provided to userspace
