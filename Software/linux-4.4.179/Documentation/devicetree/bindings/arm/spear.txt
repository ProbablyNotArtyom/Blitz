The x86 kvm shadow mmu
======================

The mmu (in arch/x86/kvm, files mmu.[ch] and paging_tmpl.h) is responsible
for presenting a standard x86 mmu to the guest, while translating guest
physical addresses to host physical addresses.

The mmu code attempts to satisfy the following requirements:

- correctness: the guest should not be able to determine that it is running
               on an emulated mmu except for timing (we attempt to comply
               with the specification, not emulate the characteristics of
               a particular implementation such as tlb size)
- security:    the guest must not be able to touch host memory not assigned
               to it
- performance: minimize the performance penalty imposed by the mmu
- scaling:     need to scale to large memory and large vcpu guests
- hardware:    support the
