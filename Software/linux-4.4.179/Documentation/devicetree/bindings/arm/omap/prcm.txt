   Linux kernel WiMAX stack

   (C) 2008 Intel Corporation < linux-wimax@intel.com >

   This provides a basic Linux kernel WiMAX stack to provide a common
   control API for WiMAX devices, usable from kernel and user space.

1. Design

   The WiMAX stack is designed to provide for common WiMAX control
   services to current and future WiMAX devices from any vendor.

   Because currently there is only one and we don't know what would be the
   common services, the APIs it currently provides are very minimal.
   However, it is done in such a way that it is easily extensible to
   accommodate future requirements.

   The stack works by embedding a struct wimax_dev in your device's
   control structures. This provides a set of callbacks that the WiMAX
   stack will call in order to implement control operations requested by
   the user. As well, the stack provides API functions that the driver
   calls to notify about changes of state in the device.

   The stack exports the API calls needed to control the device to user
   space using generic netlink as a marshalling mechanism. You can access
   them using your own code or use the wrappers provided for your
   convenience in libwimax (in the wimax-tools package).
