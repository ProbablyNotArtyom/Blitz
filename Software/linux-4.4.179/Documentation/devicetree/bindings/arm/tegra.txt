1) Overview

One of the most complicated parts of the X86 platform, and specifically,
the virtualization of this platform is the plethora of timing devices available
and the complexity of emulating those devices.  In addition, virtualization of
time introduces a new set of challenges because it introduces a multiplexed
division of time beyond the control of the guest CPU.

First, we will describe the various timekeeping hardware available, then
present some of the problems which arise and solutions available, giving
specific recommendations for certain classes of KVM guests.
