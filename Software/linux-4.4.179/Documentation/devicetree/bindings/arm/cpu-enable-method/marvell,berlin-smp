Overcommit Accounting
=====================

The Linux kernel supports the following overcommit handling modes

0
	Heuristic overcommit handling. Obvious overcommits of address
	space are refused. Used for a typical system. It ensures a
	seriously wild allocation fails while allowing overcommit to
	reduce swap usage.  root is allowed to allocate slightly more
	memory in this mode. This is the default.

1
	Always overcommit. Appropriate for some scientific
	applications. Classic example is code using sparse arrays and
	just relying on the virtual memory consisting almost entirely
	of zero pages.

2
	Don't overcommit. The total address space commit for the
	system is not permitted to exceed swap + a configurable amount
	(default is 50%) of physical RAM.  Depending on the amount you
	use, in most situations this means a process will not be
	killed while accessing pages but will receive errors on memory
	allocation as appropriate.

	Useful for applications that want
