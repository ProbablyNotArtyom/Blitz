This feature is enabled by the CONFIG_INTEL_RDT Kconfig and the
X86 /proc/cpuinfo flag bits:
RDT (Resource Director Technology) Allocation - "rdt_a"
CAT (Cache Allocation Technology) - "cat_l3", "cat_l2"
CDP (Code and Data Prioritization ) - "cdp_l3", "cdp_l2"
CQM (Cache QoS Monitoring) - "cqm_llc", "cqm_occup_llc"
MBM (Memory Bandwidth Monitoring) - "cqm_mbm_total", "cqm_mbm_local"
MBA (Memory Bandwidth Allocation) - "mba"

To use the feature mount the file system:

 # mount -t resctrl resctrl [-o cdp[,cdpl2][,mba_MBps]] /sys/fs/resctrl

mount options are:

"cdp": Enable code/data prioritization in L3 cache allocations.
"cdpl2": Enable code/data prioritization in L2 cache allocations.
"mba_MBps": Enable the MBA Software Controller(mba_sc) to specify MBA
 bandwidth in MBps

L2 and L3 CDP are controlled seperately.

RDT features are orthogonal. A particular system may support only
monitoring, only control, or both monitoring and control.  Cache
pseudo-locking is a unique way of using cache control to "pin" or
"lock" data in the cache. Details can be found in
"Cache Pseudo-Locking".


The mount succeeds if either of allocation or monitoring is present, but
only those files and directories supported by the system will be created.
For more details on the behavior of the interface during monitoring
and allocation, see the "Resource alloc and monitor groups" section.

Info directory
--------------

The 'info' directory contains information about the enabled
resources. Each resource has its own subdirectory. The subdirectory
names reflect the resource names.

Each subdirectory contains the following files with respect to
allocation:

Cache resource(L3/L2)  subdirectory contains the following files
related to allocation:

"num_closids":  	The number of CLOSIDs which are valid for this
			resource. The kernel uses the smallest number of
			CLOSIDs of all enabled resources as limit.

"cbm_mask":     	The bitmask which is valid for this resource.
			This mask is equivalent to 100%.

"min_cbm_bits": 	The minimum number of consecutive bits which
			must be set when writing a mask.

"shareable_bits":	Bitmask of shareable
