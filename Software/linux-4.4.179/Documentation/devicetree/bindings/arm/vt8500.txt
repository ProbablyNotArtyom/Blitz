ARM Virtual Generic Interrupt Controller v2 (VGIC)
==================================================

Device types supported:
  KVM_DEV_TYPE_ARM_VGIC_V2     ARM Generic Interrupt Controller v2.0

Only one VGIC instance may be instantiated through either this API or the
legacy KVM_CREATE_IRQCHIP API.  The created VGIC will act as the VM interrupt
controller, requiring emulated user-space devices to inject interrupts to the
VGIC instead of directly to CPUs.

GICv3 implementations with hardware compatibility support allow creating a
guest GICv2 through this interface.  For information on creating a guest GICv3
device and guest ITS devices, see arm-vgic-v3.txt.  It is not possible to
create both a GICv3 and GICv2 device on the same VM.
