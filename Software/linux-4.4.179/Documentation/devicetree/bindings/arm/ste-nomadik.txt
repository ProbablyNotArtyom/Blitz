Nested VMX
==========

Overview
---------

On Intel processors, KVM uses Intel's VMX (Virtual-Machine eXtensions)
to easily and efficiently run guest operating systems. Normally, these guests
*cannot* themselves be hypervisors running their own guests, because in VMX,
guests cannot use VMX instructions.

The "Nested VMX" feature adds this missing capability - of running guest
hypervisors (which use VMX) with their own nested guests. It does so by
allowing a guest to use VMX instructions, and correctly and efficiently
emulating them using the single level of VMX available in the hardware.

We describe in much greater detail the theory behind the nested VMX feature,
its implementation and its performance characteristics, in the OSDI 2010 paper
"The Turtles Project: Design and Implementation of Nested Virtualization",
