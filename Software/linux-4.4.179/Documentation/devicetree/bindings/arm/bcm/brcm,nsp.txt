What is hwpoison?
=================

Upcoming Intel CPUs have support for recovering from some memory errors
(``MCA recovery``). This requires the OS to declare a page "poisoned",
kill the processes associated with it and avoid using it in the future.

This patchkit implements the necessary infrastructure in the VM.

To quote the overview comment:

 * High level machine check handler. Handles pages reported by the
 * hardware as being corrupted usually due to a 2bit ECC memory or cache
 * failure.
 *
 * This focusses on pages detected as corrupted in the background.
 * When the current CPU tries to consume corruption the currently
 * running process can just be killed directly instead. This implies
 * that if the error cannot be handled for some reason it's safe to
 * just ignore it because no corruption has been consumed yet. Instead
 * when that happens another machine check will happen.
