This file documents some of the kernel entries in
arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S.  A lot of this explanation is adapted from
an email from Ingo Molnar:

The x86 architecture has quite a few different ways to jump into
kernel code.  Most of these entry points are registered in
arch/x86/kernel/traps.c and implemented in arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S
for 64-bit, arch/x86/entry/entry_32.S for 32-bit and finally
arch/x86/entry/entry_64_compat.S which implements the 32-bit compatibility
syscall entry points and thus provides for 32-bit processes the
ability to execute syscalls when running on 64-bit kernels.

The IDT vector assignments are listed in arch/x86/include/asm/irq_vectors.h.

Some of these entries are:
