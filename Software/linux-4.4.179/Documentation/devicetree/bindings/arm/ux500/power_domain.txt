== Overview ==

Original x86-64 was limited by 4-level paing to 256 TiB of virtual address
space and 64 TiB of physical address space. We are already bumping into
this limit: some vendors offers servers with 64 TiB of memory today.

To overcome the limitation upcoming hardware will introduce support for
5-level paging. It is a straight-forward extension of the current page
table structure adding one more layer of translation.

It bumps the limits to 128 PiB of virtual address space and 4 PiB of
physical address space. This "ought to be enough for anybody" Â©.

QEMU 2.9 and later support 5-level paging.

Virtual memory layout for 5-level paging is described in
Documentation/x86/x86_64/mm.txt

== Enabling 5-level paging ==

CONFIG_X86_5LEVEL=y enables the feature.

Kernel with CONFIG_X86_5LEVEL=y still able to boot on 4-level hardware.
In this case additional pag
