Overview
========

Page Table Isolation (pti, previously known as KAISER[1]) is a
countermeasure against attacks on the shared user/kernel address
space such as the "Meltdown" approach[2].

To mitigate this class of attacks, we create an independent set of
page tables for use only when running userspace applications.  When
the kernel is entered via syscalls, interrupts or exceptions, the
page tables are switched to the full "kernel" copy.  When the system
switches back to user mode, the user copy is used again.
