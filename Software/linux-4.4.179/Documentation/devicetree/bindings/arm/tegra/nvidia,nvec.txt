Phasing out MTRR use

MTRR use is replaced on modern x86 hardware with PAT. Direct MTRR use by
drivers on Linux is now completely phased out, device drivers should use
arch_phys_wc_add() in combination with ioremap_wc() to make MTRR effective on
non-PAT systems while a no-op but equally effective on PAT enabled systems.

Even if Linux does not use MTRRs directly, some x86 platform firmware may still
set up MTRRs early before booting the OS. They do this as some platform
firmware may still have implemente
