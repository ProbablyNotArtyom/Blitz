Introduction
============

This document describes the Linux memory manager's "Unevictable LRU"
infrastructure and the use of this to manage several types of "unevictable"
pages.

The document attempts to provide the overall rationale behind this mechanism
and the rationale for some of the design decisions that drove the
implementation.  The latter design rationale is discussed in the context of an
implementation description.  Admittedly, one can obtain the implementation
details - the "what does it do?" - by reading the code.  One hopes that the
descriptions below add value by provide the answer to "why does it do that?".



The Unevictable LRU

The Unevictable LRU facility adds an additional LRU list to trac
