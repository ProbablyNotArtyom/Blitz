This allocator is designed for use with zram. Thus, the allocator is
supposed to work well under low memory conditions. In particular, it
never attempts higher order page allocation which is very likely to
fail under memory pressure. On the other hand, if we just use single
(0-order) pages, it would suffer from very high fragmentation --
any object of size PAGE_SIZE/2 or larger would occupy an entire page.
This was one of the major issues with its predecessor (xvmalloc).

To overcome these issues, zsmalloc allocates a bunch of 0-order pages
and links them together using various 'struct page' fields. These linked
pages act as a single higher-order page i.e. an object can span 0-order
page boundaries. The code refers to these linked pages as a single entity
called zspage.

For simplicity, zsmalloc can only allocate obj
