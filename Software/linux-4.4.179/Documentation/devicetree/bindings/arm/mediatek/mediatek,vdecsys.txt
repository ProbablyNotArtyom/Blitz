The 1-wire (w1) subsystem
------------------------------------------------------------------
The 1-wire bus is a simple master-slave bus that communicates via a single
signal wire (plus ground, so two wires).

Devices communicate on the bus by pulling the signal to ground via an open
drain output and by sampling the logic level of the signal line.

The w1 subsystem provides the framework for managing w1 masters and
communication with slaves.

All w1 slave devices must be connected to a w1 bus master device.

Example w1 master devices:
    DS9490 usb device
    W1-over-GPI
