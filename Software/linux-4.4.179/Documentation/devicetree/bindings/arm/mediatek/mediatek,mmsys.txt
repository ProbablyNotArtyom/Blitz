z3fold is a special purpose allocator for storing compressed pages.
It is designed to store up to three compressed pages per physical page.
It is a zbud derivative which allows for higher compression
ratio keeping the simplicity and determinism of its predecessor.

The main differences between z3fold and zbud are:

* unlike zbud, z3fold allows for up to PAGE_SIZE allocations
* z3fold can hold up to 3 compressed pages in its page
* z3fold doesn't export any API itself and is thus intended to be used
  via the zpool API.
