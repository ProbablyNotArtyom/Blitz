 * 0xd0000000). The 0xf1000000 is the default used by the recent,
 * DT-capable, U-Boot bootloaders provided by Marvell. Some earlier
 * boards were delivered with an older version of the bootloader that
 * left internal registers mapped at 0xd0000000. If you are in this
 * situation, you should either update your bootloader (preferred
 * solution) or the below Device Tree should be adjusted.
