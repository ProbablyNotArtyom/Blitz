 *
 *  Special dma_{map/unmap/dma_sync}_* routines for systems that have
 *  limited DMA windows. These functions utilize bounce buffers to
 *  copy data to/from buffers located outside the DMA region. This
 *  only works for systems in which DMA memory is at the bottom of
 *  RAM, the remainder of memory is at the top and the DMA memory
 *  can be marked as ZONE_DMA. Anything beyond that such as discontiguous
 *  DMA windows will require custom implementations that reserve memory
 *  areas at early bootup.
