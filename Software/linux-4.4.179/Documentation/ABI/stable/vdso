Tuners
======

Video input devices can have one or more tuners demodulating a RF
signal. Each tuner is associated with one or more video inputs,
depending on the number of RF connectors on the tuner. The ``type``
field of the respective struct :c:type:`v4l2_input`
returned by the :ref:`VIDIOC_ENUMINPUT` ioctl is
set to ``V4L2_INPUT_TYPE_TUNER`` and its ``tuner`` field contains the
index number of the tuner.

Radio input devices have exactly one tuner with index zero, no video
inputs.

To query and change tuner properties applications use the
:ref:`VIDIOC_G_TUNER <VIDIOC_G_TUNER>` and
:ref:`VIDIOC_S_TUNER <VIDIOC_G_TUNER>` ioctls, respectively. The
struct :c:type:`v4l2_tuner` returned by :ref:`VIDIOC_G_TUNER <VIDIOC_G_TUNER>`
also contains signal status information applicable when the tuner of the
current video or radio input is queried.

.. note::

   :ref:`VIDIOC_S_TUNER <VIDIOC_G_TUNER>` does not switch the
   current tuner, when there is more than one at all. The tuner is solely
   determined by the current video input. Drivers must support both ioctls
   and set the ``V4L2_CAP_TUNER`` flag in the struct :c:type:`v4l2_capability`
   returned by the :ref:`VIDIOC_QUERYCAP` ioctl when the
