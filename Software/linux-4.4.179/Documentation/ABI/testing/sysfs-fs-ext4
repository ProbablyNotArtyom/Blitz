1.1 PRODUCT OVERVIEW

The CS8900-based ISA Ethernet Adapters from Cirrus Logic follow 
IEEE 802.3 standards and support half or full-duplex operation in ISA bus 
computers on 10 Mbps Ethernet networks.  The adapters are designed for operation 
in 16-bit ISA or EISA bus expansion slots and are available in 
10BaseT-only or 3-media configurations (10BaseT, 10Base2, and AUI for 10Base-5 
or fiber networks).  

CS8920-based adapters are similar to the CS8900-based adapter with additional 
features for Plug and Play (PnP) support and Wakeup Frame recognition.  As 
such, the configuration procedures differ somewhat between the two types of 
adapters.  Refer to the "Adapter Configuration" section for details on 
configuring both types of adapters.


1.2 DRIVER DESCRIPTION

The CS8900/CS8920 Ethernet Adapter driver for Linux supports the Linux
v2.3.48 or greater kernel.  It can be compiled directly into the kernel
or loaded at run-time as a device driver module.
