Introduction
------------

This file documents the Texas Instruments OMAP 3 Image Signal Processor (ISP)
driver located under drivers/media/platform/omap3isp. The original driver was
written by Texas Instruments but since that it has been rewritten (twice) at
Nokia.

The driver has been successfully used on the following versions of OMAP 3:

- 3430
- 3530
- 3630

The driver implements V4L2, Media controller and v4l2_subdev interfaces.
Sensor, lens and flash drivers using the v4l2_subdev interface in the kernel
are supported.


Split to subdevs
----------------

The OMAP 3 ISP is split into V4L2 subdevs, each of the blocks inside the ISP
having one subdev to represent it. Each of the subdevs provide a V4L2 subdev
interface to userspace.
