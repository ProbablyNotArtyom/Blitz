This document was made based on 'C' code for Linux from Gideon le Grange
(legrang@active.co.za or legrang@cs.sun.ac.za) in 1994, and elaborations from
Frans Brinkman (brinkman@esd.nl) in 1996.  The results reported here are from
experiments that the author performed on his own setup, so your mileage may
vary... I make no guarantees, claims or warranties to the suitability or
validity of this information.  No other documentation on the AIMS
Lab (http://www.aimslab.com/) RadioTrack card was made available to the
author.  This document is offered in the hopes that it might help users who
want to use the RadioTrack card in an environment other than MS Windows.
