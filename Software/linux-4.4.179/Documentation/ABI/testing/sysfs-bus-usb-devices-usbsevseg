i.MX Video Capture Driver
=========================

Introduction
------------

The Freescale i.MX5/6 contains an Image Processing Unit (IPU), which
handles the flow of image frames to and from capture devices and
display devices.

For image capture, the IPU contains the following internal subunits:

- Image DMA Controller (IDMAC)
- Camera Serial Interface (CSI)
- Image Converter (IC)
- Sensor Multi-FIFO Controller (SMFC)
- Image Rotator (IRT)
- Video De-Interlacing or Combining Block (VDIC)

The IDMAC is the DMA controller for transfer of image frames to and from
memory. Various dedicated DMA channels exist for both video capture and
display paths. During transfer, the IDMAC is also capable of vertical
image flip, 8x8 block transfer (see IRT description), pixel component
re-ordering (for example UYVY to YUYV) within the same colorspace, and
even packed <--> planar conversion. It can also perform a simple
de-interlacing by interleaving even and odd lines during transfer
(without motion compensation which requires the VDIC).

The CSI is the backend capture unit that interfaces directly with
camera sensors over Parallel, BT.656/1120, and MIPI CSI-2 busses.

The IC handles color-space conversion, resizing (downscaling and
upscaling), horizontal flip, and 90/270 degree rotation operations.

There are three independent "tasks" within the IC that can carry out
conversions concurrently: pre-process encoding, pre-process viewfinder,
and post-processing. Within each task, conversions are split into three
sections: downsizi
