                    Linux DECnet Networking Layer Information
                   ===========================================

1) Other documentation....

   o Project Home Pages
       http://www.chygwyn.com/                      	    - Kernel info
       http://linux-decnet.sourceforge.net/                - Userland tools
       http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/linux-decnet/   - Status page

2) Configuring the kernel

Be sure to turn on the following options:

    CONFIG_DECNET (obviously)
    CONFIG_PROC_FS (to see what's going on)
    CONFIG_SYSCTL (for easy configuration)

if you want to try out router support (not properly debugged yet)
you'll need the following options as well...

    CONFIG_DECNET_ROUTER (to be able to add/delete routes)
    CONFIG_NETFILTER (will be required for the DECnet routing daemon)

    CONFIG_DECNET_ROUTE_FWMARK is optional

Don't turn on SIOCGIFCONF support for DECnet unless you are really sure
that you need it, in general you won't and it can cause ifconfig to
malfunction.
