Transmit path guidelines:

1) The ndo_start_xmit method must not return NETDEV_TX_BUSY under
   any normal circumstances.  It is considered a hard error unless
   there is no way your device can tell ahead of time when it's
   transmit function will become busy.

   Instead it must maintain the queue properly.  For example,
   for a driver implementing scatter-gather this means:

	static netdev_tx_t drv_hard_start_xmit(struct sk_buff *skb,
					       struct net_device *dev)
	{
		struct drv *dp = netdev_priv(dev);

		lock_tx(dp);
		...
		/* This is a hard error log it. */
		if (TX_BUFFS_AVAIL(dp) <= (skb_shinfo(s
