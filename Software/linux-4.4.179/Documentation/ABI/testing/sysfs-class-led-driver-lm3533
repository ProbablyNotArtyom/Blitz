The saa7134 driver
==================

Author Gerd Hoffmann


This is a v4l2/oss device driver for saa7130/33/34/35 based capture / TV
boards.  See http://www.semiconductors.philips.com/pip/saa7134hl for a
description.


Status
------

Almost everything is working.  video, sound, tuner, radio, mpeg ts, ...

As with bttv, card-specific tweaks are needed.  Check CARDLIST for a
list of known TV cards and saa7134-cards.c for the drivers card
configuration info.


Build
-----

Pick up videodev + v4l2 patches from http://bytesex.org/patches/.
Configure, build, install + boot the new kernel.  You'll need at least
these config options:

.. code-block:: none

	CONFIG_I2C=m
	CONFIG_VIDEO_DEV=m

Type "make" to build the driver now.  "make install" installs the
driver.  "modprobe saa7134" should load it.  Depending on the card you
might have to pass card=<nr> as insmod option, check CARDLIST for
valid choices.


Changes / Fixes
---------------

Please mail me unified diffs ("diff -u") with your changes, and don't
forget to tell me what it changes / which problem it fixes / whatever
it is good for ...


Known Problems
--------------

* The tuner for the flyvideos isn't detected automatically and the
  default might not work for you depending on which version you have.
  There is a tuner= insmod option to override the driver's default.

Card Variations:
----------------

Cards can use either of these two crystals (xtal):

- 32.11 MHz -> .audio_clock=0x187de7
- 24.576MHz -> .audio_clock=0x200000 (xtal * .audio_clock = 51539600)
