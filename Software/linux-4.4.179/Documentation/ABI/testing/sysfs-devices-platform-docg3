Upgrading BIOS using intel-spi
------------------------------

Many Intel CPUs like Baytrail and Braswell include SPI serial flash host
controller which is used to hold BIOS and other platform specific data.
Since contents of the SPI serial flash is crucial for machine to function,
it is typically protected by different hardware protection mechanisms to
avoid accidental (or on purpose) overwrite of the content.

Not all manufacturers protect the SPI serial flash, mainly because it
allows upgrading the BIOS image directly from an OS.

The intel-spi driver makes it possible to read and write the SPI serial
flash, if certain protection bits are not set and locked. If it finds
any of them set, the whole MTD device is made read-only to prevent
partial overwrites. By default the driver exposes SPI serial flash
contents as read-only but it can be changed from kernel command line,
passing "intel-spi.writeable=1".

Please keep in mind that overwriting the BIOS image on SPI serial flash
might render the machine unbootable and requires special equipment like
Dediprog to revive. You have been warned!
