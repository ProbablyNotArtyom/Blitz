Text File for the COPS LocalTalk Linux driver (cops.c).
	By Jay Schulist <jschlst@samba.org>

This driver has two modes and they are: Dayna mode and Tangent mode.
Each mode corresponds with the type of card. It has been found
that there are 2 main types of cards and all other cards are
the same and just have different names or only have minor differences
such as more IO ports. As this driver is tested it will
become more clear exactly what cards are supported. 

Right now these cards are known to work with the COPS driver. The
LT-200 cards work in a somewhat more limited capacity than the
DL200 cards, which work very well and are in use by many people.

TANGENT driver mode:
	Tangent ATB-II, Novell NL-1000, Daystar Digital LT-200
DAYNA driver mode:
	Dayna DL2000/DaynaTalk PC (Half Length), COPS LT-95,
	Farallon PhoneNET PC III, Farallon PhoneNET PC II
Other cards possibly suppo
