In 'drivers/net/gtp.c' you are finding a kernel-level implementation
of a GTP tunnel endpoint.

== What is GTP ==

GTP is the Generic Tunnel Protocol, which is a 3GPP protocol used for
tunneling User-IP payload between a mobile station (phone, modem)
and the interconnection between an external packet data network (such
as the internet).

So when you start a 'data connection' from your mobile phone, the
phone will use the control plane to signal for the establishment of
such a tunnel between that external data network and the phone.  The
tunnel endpoints thus reside on the phone and in the gateway.  All
intermediate nodes just transport the encapsulated packet.

The phone itself does not implement GTP but uses some other
technology-dependent protocol stack for transmitting the user IP
payload, such as LLC/SNDCP/RLC/MAC.

At some network element inside the cellular operator infrastructure
(SGSN in case of GPRS/EGPRS or classic UMTS, hNodeB in case of a 3G
femtocell, eNodeB in case of 4G/LTE), the cellular protocol stacking
is translated into GTP *without breaking the end-to-end tunnel*.  So
intermediate nodes just perform some specific relay function.

At some point the GTP packet ends up on the so-called GGSN (GSM/UMTS)
or P-GW (LTE), which terminates the tunnel, decapsulates the packet
and forwards it onto an external packet data network.  This can be
public internet, but can also be any private IP network (or even
theoretically some non-IP network like X.25).

You can find the protocol specification in 3GPP TS 29.060, av
