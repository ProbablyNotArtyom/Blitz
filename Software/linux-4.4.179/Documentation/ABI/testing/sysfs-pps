This file describes the iavf Linux* Base Driver. This driver was formerly
called i40evf.

The iavf driver supports the below mentioned virtual function devices and
can only be activated on kernels running the i40e or newer Physical Function
(PF) driver compiled with CONFIG_PCI_IOV.  The iavf driver requires
CONFIG_PCI_MSI to be enabled.

The guest OS loading the iavf driver must support MSI-X interrupts.

Identifying Your Adapter
========================
The driver in this kernel is compatible with devices based on the following:
 * Intel(R) XL710 X710 Virtual Function
 * Intel(R) X722 Virtual Function
 * Intel(R) XXV710 Virtual Function
 * Intel(R) Ethernet Adaptive Virtual Function

For the best performance, make sure the latest NVM/FW is installed on your
device.

For information on how to identify your adapter, and for the latest NVM/FW
images and Intel network drivers, refer to the Intel Support website:

Viewing Link Messages
---------------------
Link messages will not be displayed to the console if the distribution is
restricting system messages. In order to see network driver link messages on
your console, set dmesg to eight by entering the following::

  dmesg -n 8

NOTE: This setting is not saved across reboots.

ethtool
-------
The driver utilizes the ethtool interface for driver configuration and
diagnostics, as well as displaying statistical information. The latest ethtool
version is required for this functionality. Download it at:
