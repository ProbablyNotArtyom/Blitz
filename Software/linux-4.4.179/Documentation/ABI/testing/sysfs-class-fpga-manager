Qualcomm Camera Subsystem driver
================================

Introduction
------------

This file documents the Qualcomm Camera Subsystem driver located under
drivers/media/platform/qcom/camss.

The current version of the driver supports the Camera Subsystem found on
Qualcomm MSM8916/APQ8016 and MSM8996/APQ8096 processors.

The driver implements V4L2, Media controller and V4L2 subdev interfaces.
Camera sensor using V4L2 subdev interface in the kernel is supported.

The driver is implemented using as a reference the Qualcomm Camera Subsystem
driver for Android as found in Code Aurora [#f1]_ [#f2]_.


Qualcomm Camera Subsystem hardware
----------------------------------

The Camera Subsystem hardware found on 8x16 / 8x96 processors and supported by
the driver consists of:

- 2 / 3 CSIPHY modules. They handle the Physical layer of the CSI2 receivers.
  A separate camera sensor can be connected to each of the CSIPHY module;
- 2 / 4 CSID (CSI Decoder) modules. They handle the Protocol and Application
  layer of the CSI2 receivers. A CSID can decode data stream from any of the
  CSIPHY. Each CSID also contains a TG (Test Generator) block which can generate
  artificial input data for test purposes;
- ISPIF (ISP Interface) module. Handles the routing of the data streams from
  the CSIDs to the inputs of the VFE;
- 1 / 2 VFE (Video Front End) module(s). Contain a pipeline of image processing
  hardware blocks. The VFE has different input interfaces. The PIX (Pixel) input
  interface feeds the input data to the ima
