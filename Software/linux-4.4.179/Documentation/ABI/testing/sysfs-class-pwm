The Symmetric Communication Interface (SCIF (pronounced as skiff)) is a low
level communications API across PCIe currently implemented for MIC. Currently
SCIF provides inter-node communication within a single host platform, where a
node is a MIC Coprocessor or Xeon based host. SCIF abstracts the details of
communicating over the PCIe bus while providing an API that is symmetric
across all the nodes in the PCIe network. An important design objective for SCIF
is to deliver the maximum possible performance given the communication
abilities of the hardware. SCIF has been used to implement an offload compiler
runtime and OFED support for MPI implementations for MIC coprocessors.

==== SCIF API Components ====
The SCIF API has the following parts:
1. Connection establishment using a client server model
2. Byte stream messaging intended for short messages
3. Node enumeration to determine online nodes
4. Poll semantics for detection of incoming connections and messages
5. Memory registration to pin down pages
6. Remote memory mapping for low latency CPU accesses via mmap
7. Remote DMA (RDMA) for high bandwidth DMA transfers
8. Fence APIs for RDMA synchronization

SCIF exposes the notion of a connection which can be used by peer processes on
nodes in a SCIF PCIe "network" to share memory "windows" and to communicate. A
process in a SCIF node initiates a SCIF connection to a peer process on a
different node via a SCIF "endpoint". SCIF endpoints support messaging APIs
which are similar to connection oriented socket APIs. Connected SCIF endpoints
can also register local memory which is followed by data transfer using either
DMA, CPU copies or remote memory mapping via mmap. SCIF supports both user and
kernel mode clients which are functionally equivalent.

==== SCIF Performance for MIC ====
DMA bandwidth comparison between the TCP (over ethernet over PCIe) stack versus
SCIF shows the performance advantages of SCIF for HPC applications and runtimes.
