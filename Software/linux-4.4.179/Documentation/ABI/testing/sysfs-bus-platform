Functional partitioning
-----------------------

Consists of the following (in the same order as the list under file
partitioning):

 1. V4L2 display driver
    Implements creation of video2 and video3 device nodes and
    provides v4l2 device interface to manage VID0 and VID1 layers.

 2. Display controller
    Loads up VENC, OSD and external encoders such as ths8200. It provides
    a set of API calls to V4L2 dri
