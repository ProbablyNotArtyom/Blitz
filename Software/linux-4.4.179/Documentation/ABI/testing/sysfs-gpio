Introduction
============
Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) is an unreliable, connection
oriented protocol designed to solve issues present in UDP and TCP, particularly
for real-time and multimedia (streaming) traffic.
It divides into a base protocol (RFC 4340) and pluggable congestion control
modules called CCIDs. Like pluggable TCP congestion control, at least one CCID
needs to be enabled in order for the protocol to function properly. In the Linux
implementation, this is the TCP-like CCID2 (RFC 4341). Additional CCIDs, such as
the TCP-friendly CCID3 (RFC 4342), are optional.
For a brief introduction to CCIDs and suggestions for choosing a CCID to match
given applications, see section 10 of RFC 4340.

It has a base protocol and pluggable congestion control IDs (CCIDs).

DCCP is a Proposed Standard (RFC 2026), and the homepage for DCCP as a protocol
is at http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/dccp-charter.html


Missing features
================
The Linux DCCP implementation does not currently support all the features that are
specified in RFCs 4340...
