       Altera Triple-Speed Ethernet MAC driver

Copyright (C) 2008-2014 Altera Corporation

This is the driver for the Altera Triple-Speed Ethernet (TSE) controllers
using the SGDMA and MSGDMA soft DMA IP components. The driver uses the
platform bus to obtain component resources. The designs used to test this
driver were built for a Cyclone(R) V SOC FPGA board, a Cyclone(R) V FPGA board,
and tested with ARM and NIOS processor hosts separately. The anticipated use
cases are simple communications between an embedded system and an external peer
for status and simple configuration of the embedded system.

forums for the driver may be found on www.rocketboards.org, and a design used
