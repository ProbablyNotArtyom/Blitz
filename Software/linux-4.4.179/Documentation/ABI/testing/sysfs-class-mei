Information from Silicon Labs
-----------------------------

Silicon Laboratories is the manufacturer of the radio ICs, that nowadays are the
most often used radio receivers in cell phones. Usually they are connected with
I2C. But SiLabs also provides a reference design, which integrates this IC,
together with a small microcontroller C8051F321, to form a USB radio.
Part of this reference design is also a radio application in binary and source
code. The software also contains an automatic firmware upgrade to the most
current version. Information on these can be downloaded here:
