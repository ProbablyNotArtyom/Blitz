Description
-----------

APDS990x is a combined ambient light and proximity sensor. ALS and proximity
functionality are highly connected. ALS measurement path must be running
while the proximity functionality is enabled.

ALS produces raw measurement values for two channels: Clear channel
(infrared + visible light) and IR only. However, threshold comparisons happen
using clear channel only. Lux value and the threshold level on the HW
might vary quite much depending the spectrum of the light source.

Driver makes necessary conversions to both directio
