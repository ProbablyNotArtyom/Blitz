 * Overview

NetLabel is a mechanism which can set and retrieve security attributes from
network packets.  It is intended to be used by LSM developers who want to make
use of a common code base for several different packet labeling protocols.
The NetLabel security module API is defined in 'include/net/netlabel.h' but a
brief overview is given below.

 * NetLabel Security Attributes

Since NetLabel supports multiple different packet labeling protocols and LSMs
it uses the concept of security attributes to refer to the packet's security
labels.  The NetLabel security attributes are defined by the
'netlbl_lsm_secattr' structure in the NetLabel header file.  Internally the
NetLabel subsystem converts the se
