Intel(R) Management Engine (ME) Client bus API
==============================================


Rationale
=========

MEI misc character device is useful for dedicated applications to send and receive
data to the many FW appliance found in Intel's ME from the user space.
However for some of the ME functionalities it make sense to leverage existing software
stack and expose them through existing kernel subsystems.

In order to plug seamlessly into the kernel device driver model we add kernel virtual
bus abstraction on top of the MEI driver. This allows implementing linux kernel drivers
for the various MEI features as a stand alone entities found in their respective subsystem.
