DCTCP (DataCenter TCP)
----------------------

DCTCP is an enhancement to the TCP congestion control algorithm for data
center networks and leverages Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) in
the data center network to provide multi-bit feedback to the end hosts.

To enable it on end hosts:

  sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control=dctcp
  sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_ecn_fallback=0 (optional)

All switches in the data center network running DCTCP must support ECN
marking and be configured for marking when reaching defined switch buffer
thresholds. The default ECN marking threshold heuristic for DCTCP on
switches is 20 packets (30KB) at 1Gbps, and 65 packets (~100KB) at 10Gbps,
but might need further careful tweaking.
