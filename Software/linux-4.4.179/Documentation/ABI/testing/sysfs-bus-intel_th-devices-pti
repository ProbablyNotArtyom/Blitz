The bttv driver
===============

Release notes for bttv
----------------------

You'll need at least these config options for bttv:

.. code-block:: none

	CONFIG_I2C=m
	CONFIG_I2C_ALGOBIT=m
	CONFIG_VIDEO_DEV=m

The latest bttv version is available from http://bytesex.org/bttv/


Make bttv work with your card
-----------------------------

Just try "modprobe bttv" and see if that works.

If it doesn't bttv likely could not autodetect your card and needs some
insmod options.  The most important insmod option for bttv is "card=n"
to select the correct card type.  If you get video but no sound you've
very likely specified the wrong (or no) card type.  A list of supported
cards is in CARDLIST.bttv

If bttv takes very long to load (happens sometimes with the cheap
cards which have no tuner), try adding this to your modules.conf:

.. code-block:: none

	options i2c-algo-bit bit_test=1

For the WinTV/PVR you need one
