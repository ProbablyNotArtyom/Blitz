FEATURES
========

 Adaptive Interrupts (adaptive-rx)
 ---------------------------------

  This feature provides an adaptive algorithm that adjusts the interrupt
  coalescing parameters, allowing the driver to dynamically adapt the latency
  settings to achieve the highest performance during various types of network
  load.

  The interface used to control this feature is ethtool. Please see the
  ethtool manpage for additional usage information.

  By default, adaptive-rx is disabled.
  To enable adaptive-rx:

      ethtool -C <interface> adaptive-rx on

  To disable adaptive-rx, use ethtool:

      ethtool -C <interface> adaptive-rx off
