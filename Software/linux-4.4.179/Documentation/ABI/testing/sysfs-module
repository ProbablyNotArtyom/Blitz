Identifying Your Adapter
========================
For information on how to identify your adapter, and for the latest Intel
network drivers, refer to the Intel Support website:
https://www.intel.com/support


Command Line Parameters
=======================
If the driver is built as a module, the following optional parameters are used
by entering them on the command line with the modprobe command using this
syntax::

    modprobe e1000e [<option>=<VAL1>,<VAL2>,...]

There needs to be a <VAL#> for each network port in the system supported by
this driver. The values will be applied to each instance, in function order.
For example::

    modprobe e1000e InterruptThrottleRate=16000,16000

In this case, there are two network ports supported by e1000e in the system.
The default value for each parameter is generally the recommended setting,
unless otherwise noted.

NOTE: A descriptor describes a data buffer and attributes related to the data
buffer. This information is accessed by the hardware.

InterruptThrottleRate
---------------------
:Valid Range: 0,1,3,4,100-100000
:Default Value: 3

Interrupt Throttle Rate controls the number of interrupts each interrupt
vector can generate per second. Increasing ITR lowers latency at the cost of
increased CPU utilization, though it may help throughput in some circumstances.

Setting InterruptThrottleRate to a value greater
