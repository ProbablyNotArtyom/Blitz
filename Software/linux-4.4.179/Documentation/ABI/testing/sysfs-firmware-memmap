     cdc_mbim - Driver for CDC MBIM Mobile Broadband modems
    ========================================================

The cdc_mbim driver supports USB devices conforming to the "Universal
Serial Bus Communications Class Subclass Specification for Mobile
Broadband Interface Model" [1], which is a further development of
"Universal Serial Bus Communications Class Subclass Specifications for
Network Control Model Devices" [2] optimized for Mobile Broadband
devices, aka "3G/LTE modems".


Command Line Parameters
=======================

The cdc_mbim driver has no parameters of its own.  But the probing
behaviour for NCM 1.0 backwards compatible MBIM functions (an
"NCM/MBIM function" as defined in section 3.2 of [1]) is affected
by a cdc_ncm driver parameter:

prefer_mbim
-----------
Type:          Boolean
Valid Range:   N/Y (0-1)
Default Value: Y (MBIM is preferred)

This parameter sets the system policy for NCM/MBIM functions.  Such
functions will be handled by either the cdc_ncm driver or the cdc_mbim
driver depending on the prefer_mbim setting.  Setting prefer_mbim=N
makes the cdc_mbim driver ignore these functions and lets the cdc_ncm
driver handle them instead.

The parameter is writable, and can be changed at any time. A manual
unbind/bind is required to make the change effective for NCM/MBIM
functions bound to the "wrong" driver


Basic usage
===========

MBIM functions are inactive when unmanaged. The cdc_mbim driver only
provides a userspace interface to the MBIM control channel, and will
not participate in the management of the function. This implies that a
userspace MBIM management application always is required to enable a
MBIM function.

Such userspace applications includes, but are not limited to:
 - mbimcli (included with the libmbim [3] library), and
 - ModemManager [4]

Establishing a MBIM IP session reequires at least these actions by the
management application:
 - open the control channel
 - configure network connection settings
 - connect to network
 - configure IP interface

Management application development

The driver <-> userspace interfaces are described below.  The MBIM
control channel protocol is described in [1].
