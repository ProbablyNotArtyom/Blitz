VIDIOC_REQBUFS - Initiate Memory Mapping, User Pointer I/O or DMA buffer I/O


Synopsis
========

.. c:function:: int ioctl( int fd, VIDIOC_REQBUFS, struct v4l2_requestbuffers *argp )
    :name: VIDIOC_REQBUFS


Arguments
=========

``fd``
    File descriptor returned by :ref:`open() <func-open>`.

``argp``
    Pointer to struct :c:type:`v4l2_requestbuffers`.

Description
===========

This ioctl is used to initiate :ref:`memory mapped <mmap>`,
:ref:`user pointer <userp>` or :ref:`DMABUF <dmabuf>` based I/O.
Memory mapped buffers are located in device memory and must be allocated
with this ioctl before they can be mapped into the application's address
space. User buffers are allocated by applications themselves, and this
ioctl is merely used to switch the driver into user pointer I/O mode and
to setup some internal structures. Similarly, DMABUF buffers are
allocated by applications through a device driver, and this ioctl only
configures the driver into DMABUF I/O mode without performing any direct
allocation.

To allocate device buffers applications initialize all fields of the
struct :c:type:`v4l2_requestbuffers` structure. They set the ``type``
field to the respective stream or buffer type, the ``count`` field to
the desired number of buffers, ``memory`` must be set to the requested
I/O method and the ``reserved`` array must be zeroed. When the ioctl is
called with a pointer to this structure the driver will attempt to
allocate the requested number of buffers and it stores the actual number
allocated in the ``count`` field. It can be smaller than the number
requested, even zero, when the driver runs out of free memory. A larger
number is also possible when the driver requires more buffers to
function correctly. For example video output requires at least two
