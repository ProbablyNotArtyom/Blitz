	Namespaces compatibility list

This document contains the information about the problems user
may have when creating tasks living in different namespaces.

Here's the summary. This matrix shows the known problems, that
occur when tasks share some namespace (the columns) while living
in different other namespaces (the rows):

	UTS	IPC	VFS	PID	User	Net
UTS	 X
IPC		 X	 1
VFS			 X
PID		 1	 1	 X
User		 2	 2		 X
Net						 X

1. Both the IPC and the PID namespaces provide IDs to address
   object inside the kernel. E.g. semaphore with IPCID or
   process group with pid.
