Identifying Your Adapter
========================
The driver in this release is compatible with devices based on the Intel(R)
Ethernet Multi-host Controller.

For information on how to identify your adapter, and for the latest Intel
network drivers, refer to the Intel Support website:
http://www.intel.com/support


Flow Control
------------
The Intel(R) Ethernet Switch Host Interface Driver does not support Flow
Control. It will not send pause frames. This may result in dropped frames.


Virtual Functions (VFs)
-----------------------
Use sysfs to enable VFs.
Valid Range: 0-64

For example::

    echo $num_vf_enabled > /sys/class/net/$dev/device/sriov_numvfs //enable VFs
    echo 0 > /sys/class/net/$dev/device/sriov_numvfs //disable VFs

NOTE: Neither the device nor the driver control how VFs are mapped into config
space. Bus layout will vary by operating system. On operating systems that
support it, you can check sysfs to find the mapping.

NOTE: When SR-IOV mode is enabled, hardware VLAN filtering and VLAN tag
stripping/insertion will remain enabled. Please remove the old VLAN filter
before the new VLAN filter is added. For example::

    ip link set eth0 vf 0 vlan 100	// set vlan 100 for VF 0
    ip link set eth0 vf 0 vlan 0	// Delete vlan 100
    ip link set eth0 vf 0 vlan 200	// set a new vlan 200 for VF 0


Additional Features and Configurations
======================================

Jumbo Frames
------------
Jumbo Frames support is enabled by changing the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)
to a value larger than the default value of 1500.

Use the ifconfig command to increase the MTU size. For examp
