(0) Introduction

The following are notes and information on using the 3Com EtherLink III series
ethercards in Linux. These cards are commonly known by the most widely-used
card's 3Com model number, 3c509. They are all 10mb/s ISA-bus cards and shouldn't
be (but sometimes are) confused with the similarly-numbered PCI-bus "3c905"
(aka "Vortex" or "Boomerang") series.  Kernel support for the 3c509 family is
provided by the module 3c509.c, which has code to support all of the following
models:

  3c509 (original ISA card)
