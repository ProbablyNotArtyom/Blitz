The Samsung S5P/EXYNOS4 FIMC driver
===================================

Copyright |copy| 2012 - 2013 Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.

The FIMC (Fully Interactive Mobile Camera) device available in Samsung
SoC Application Processors is an integrated camera host interface, color
space converter, image resizer and rotator.  It's also capable of capturing
data from LCD controller (FIMD) through the SoC internal writeback data
path.  There are multiple FIMC instances in the SoCs (up to 4), having
slightly different capabilities, like pixel alignment constraints, rotator
availability, LCD writeback support, etc. The driver is located at
drivers/media/platform/exynos4-is directory.

Supported SoCs
--------------

S5PC100 (mem-to-mem only), S5PV210, EXYNOS4210

Supported features
------------------

- camera parallel interface capture (ITU-R.BT601/565);
- camera serial interface capture (MIPI-CSI2);
- memory-to-memory processing (color space conversion, scaling, mirror
  and rotation);
- dynamic pipeline re-configuration at runtime (re-attachment of any FIMC
  instance to any parallel video input or any MIPI-CSI front-end);
- runtime PM and system wide suspend/resume

Not currently supported
-----------------------

- LCD writeback input
- per frame clock gating (mem-to-mem)

User space interfaces
---------------------

Media device interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The driver supports Media Controller API as defined at :ref:`media_controller`.
The media device driver name is "SAMSUNG S5P FIMC".

The purpose of this interface is to allow changing assignment of FIMC instances
to the SoC peripheral camera input at runtime and optionally to control internal
connections of the MIPI-CSIS device(s) to the FIMC entities.

The media device interface allows to configure the SoC for capturing image
data from the sensor through more than one FIMC instance (e.g. for simultaneous
viewfinder and still capture setup).
Reconfiguration is done by enabling/disabling media links created by the driver
during initialization. The internal device topology can be easily discovered
through media entity and links enumeration.

Memory-to-memory video node
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

V4L2 memory-to-memory interface at /dev/video? device node.  This is standalone
video device, it has no media pads. However please note the mem-to-mem and
capture video node operation on same FIMC instance is not allowed.  The driver
