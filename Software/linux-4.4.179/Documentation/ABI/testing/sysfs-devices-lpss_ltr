Intel(R) Management Engine Interface (Intel(R) MEI)
===================================================

Introduction
============

The Intel Management Engine (Intel ME) is an isolated and protected computing
resource (Co-processor) residing inside certain Intel chipsets. The Intel ME
provides support for computer/IT management features. The feature set
depends on the Intel chipset SKU.

The Intel Management Engine Interface (Intel MEI, previously known as HECI)
is the interface between the Host and Intel ME. This interface is exposed
to the host as a PCI device. The Intel MEI Driver is in charge of the
communication channel between a host application and the Intel ME feature.

Each Intel ME feature (Intel ME Client) is addressed by a GUID/UUID and
each client has its own protocol. The protocol is message-based with a
header and payload up to 512 bytes.

Prominent usage of the Intel ME Interface is to communicate with Intel(R)
Active Management Technology (Intel AMT) implemented in firmware running on
the Intel ME.

Intel AMT provides the ability to manage a host remotely out-of-band (OOB)
even when the operating system running on the host processor has crashed or
is in a sleep state.

Some examples of Intel AMT usage are:
   - Monitoring hardware state and platform components
   - Remote power off/on (useful for green computing or overnight IT
     maintenance)
   - OS updates
   - Storage of useful platform information such as software assets
   - Built-in hardware KVM
   - Selective network isolation of Ethernet and IP protocol flows based
     on policies set by a remote management console
   - IDE device redirection from remote management console

Intel AMT (OOB) communication is based on SOAP (deprecate
