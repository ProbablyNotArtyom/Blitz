			LC-trie implementation notes.

Node types
----------
leaf 
	An end node with data. This has a copy of the relevant key, along
	with 'hlist' with routing table entries sorted by prefix length.
	See struct leaf and struct leaf_info.

trie node or tnode
	An internal node, holding an array of child (leaf or tnode) pointers,
	indexed	through a subset of the key. See Level Compression.

A few concepts explained
------------------------
Bits (tnode) 
	The number of bits in the key segment used for indexing into the
	child array - the "child index". See Level Compression.

Pos (tnode)
	The position (in the key) of the key segment used for indexing into
	the child array. See Path Compression.

Path Compression / skipped bits
	Any given tnode is linked to from the child array of its parent, usin
