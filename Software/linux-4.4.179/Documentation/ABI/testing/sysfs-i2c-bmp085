    Originally,   this  driver  was    written  for the  Digital   Equipment
    Corporation series of EtherWORKS Ethernet cards:

        DE425 TP/COAX EISA
	DE434 TP PCI
	DE435 TP/COAX/AUI PCI
	DE450 TP/COAX/AUI PCI
	DE500 10/100 PCI Fasternet

    but it  will  now attempt  to  support all  cards which   conform to the
    Digital Semiconductor   SROM   Specification.    The  driver   currently
    recognises the following chips:

        DC21040  (no SROM) 
	DC21041[A]  
	DC21140[A] 
	DC21142 
	DC21143 

    So far the driver is known to work with the following cards:

        KINGSTON
	Linksys
	ZNYX342
	SMC8432
	SMC9332 (w/new SROM)
	ZNYX31[45]
	ZNYX346 10/100 4 port (can act as a 10/100 bridge!) 

    The driver has been tested on a relatively busy network using the DE425,
    DE434, DE435 and DE500 cards and benchmarked with 'ttcp': it transferred
    16M of data to a DECstation 5000/200 as follows:

                TCP           UDP
             TX     RX     TX     RX
    DE425   1030k  997k   1170k  1128k
    DE434   1063k  995k   1170k  1125k
    DE435   1063k  995k   1170k  1125k
    DE500   1063k  998k   1170k  1125k  in 10Mb/s mode
