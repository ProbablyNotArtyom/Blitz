***************************************
ioctl VIDIOC_STREAMON, VIDIOC_STREAMOFF
***************************************

Name
====

VIDIOC_STREAMON - VIDIOC_STREAMOFF - Start or stop streaming I/O


Synopsis
========

.. c:function:: int ioctl( int fd, VIDIOC_STREAMON, const int *argp )
    :name: VIDIOC_STREAMON

.. c:function:: int ioctl( int fd, VIDIOC_STREAMOFF, const int *argp )
    :name: VIDIOC_STREAMOFF


Arguments
=========

``fd``
    File descriptor returned by :ref:`open() <func-open>`.

``argp``
    Pointer to an integer.

Description
===========

The ``VIDIOC_STREAMON`` and ``VIDIOC_STREAMOFF`` ioctl start and stop
the capture or output process during streaming
(:ref:`memory mapping <mmap>`, :ref:`user pointer <userp>` or
:ref:`DMABUF <dmabuf>`) I/O.

Capture hardware is disabled and no input buffers are filled (if there
are any empty buffers in the incoming queue) until ``VIDIOC_STREAMON``
has been called. Output hardware is disabled and no video signal is
produced until ``VIDIOC_STREAMON`` has been called. The ioctl will
succeed when at least one output buffer is in the incoming queue.
