Netdev private dataroom for 6lowpan interfaces:

All 6lowpan able net devices, means all interfaces with ARPHRD_6LOWPAN,
must have "struct lowpan_priv" placed at beginning of netdev_priv.

The priv_size of each interface should be calculate by:

 dev->priv_size = LOWPAN_PRIV_SIZE(LL_6LOWPAN_PRIV_DATA);

Where LL_PRIV_6LOWPAN_DATA is sizeof linklayer 6lowpan private data struct.
To access the LL_PRIV_6LOWPAN_DATA structure you can cast:

 lowpan_priv(dev)-priv;
