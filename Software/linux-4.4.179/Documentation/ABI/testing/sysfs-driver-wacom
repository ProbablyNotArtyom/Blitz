manual with your ARCnet card.

Since no one seems to listen to me otherwise, perhaps a poem will get your
attention:
		This driver's getting fat and beefy,
		But my cat is still named Fifi.

Hmm, I think I'm allowed to call that a poem, even though it's only two
lines.  Hey, I'm in Computer Science, not English.  Give me a break.

The point is:  I REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY want to hear from you if
you test this and get it working.  Or if you don't.  Or anything.

ARCnet 0.32 ALPHA first made it into the Linux kernel 1.1.80 - this was
nice, but after that even FEWER people started writing to me because they
didn't even have to install the patch.  <sigh>

Come on, be a sport!  Send me a success report!

(hey, that was even better than my original poem... this is getting bad!)

WARNING:
--------

If you don't e-mail me about your success/failure soon, I may be forced to
start SINGING.  And we don't want that, do we?

(You know, it might be argued that I'm pushing this point a little too much. 
If you think so, why not flame me in a quick little e-mail?  Please also
include the type of card(s) you're using, software, size of network, and
whether it's working or not.)

These are the ARCnet drivers for Linux.


This new release (2.91) has been put together by David Woodhouse 
<dwmw2@infradead.org>, in an attempt to tidy up the driver after adding support
for yet another chipset. Now the generic support has been separated from the
individual chipset drivers, and the source files aren't quite so packed with
#ifdefs! I've changed this file a bit, but kept it in the first person from
Avery, because I didn't want to completely rewrite it.

The previous release resulted from many months of on-and-off effort from me
(Avery Pennarun), many bug reports/fixes and suggestions from others, and in
particular a lot of input and coding from Tomasz Motylewski.  Starting with
ARCnet 2.10 ALPHA, Tomasz's all-new-and-improved RFC1051 support has been
included and seems to be working fine!


Where do I discuss these drivers?
---------------------------------

Tomasz has been so kind as to set up a new and improved mailing list. 
Subscribe by sending a message with the BODY "subscribe linux-arcnet YOUR
REAL NAME" to listserv@tichy.ch.uj.edu.pl.  Then, to submit messages to the
list, mail to linux-arcnet@tichy.ch.uj.edu.pl.

There are archives of the mailing list at:
	http://epistolary.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/arcnet

The people on linux-net@vger.kernel.org (now defunct, replaced by
netdev@vger.kernel.org) have also been known to be very helpful, especially
when we're talking about ALPHA Linux kernels that may or may not work right
in the first place.


Other Drivers and Info
----------------------

You can try my ARCNET page on the World Wide Web at:
	http://www.qis.net/~jschmitz/arcnet/	

Also, SMC (one of the companies that makes ARCnet cards) has a WWW site you
might be interested in, which includes several drivers for various cards
including ARCnet.  Try:
	http://www.smc.com/
	
Performance Technologies makes various network software that supports
ARCnet:
	http://www.perftech.com/ or ftp to ftp.perftech.com.
	
Novell makes a networking stack for DOS which includes ARCnet drivers.  Try
FTPing to ftp.novell.com.

You can get the Crynwr packet driver collection (including arcether.com, the
one you'll want to use with ARCnet cards) from
oak.oakland.edu:/simtel/msdos/pktdrvr. It won't work perfectly on a 386+
without patches, though, and also doesn't like several cards.  Fixed
versions are available on my WWW page, or via e-mail if you don't have WWW
access. 


Installing the Driver
---------------------

All you will need to do in order to install the driver is:
	make config
