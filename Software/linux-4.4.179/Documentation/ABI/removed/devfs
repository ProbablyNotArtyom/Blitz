Interleaved grey-scale image, e.g. from a stereo-pair


Description
===========

This is a grey-scale image with a depth of 12 bits per pixel, but with
pixels from 2 sources interleaved and bit-packed. Each pixel is stored
in a 24-bit word in the little-endian order. On a little-endian machine
these pixels can be deinterlaced
