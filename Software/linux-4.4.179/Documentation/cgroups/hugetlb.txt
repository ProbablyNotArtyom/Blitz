    scalable figure and image handling
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Sphinx extension which implements scalable image handling.

    :copyright:  Copyright (C) 2016  Markus Heiser
    :license:    GPL Version 2, June 1991 see Linux/COPYING for details.

    The build for image formats depend on image's source format and output's
    destination format. This extension implement methods to simplify image
    handling from the author's POV. Directives like ``kernel-figure`` implement
    methods *to* always get the best output-format even if some tools are not
    installed. For more details take a look at ``convert_image(...)`` which is
    the core of all conversions.

    * ``.. kernel-image``: for image handling / a ``.. image::`` replacement

    * ``.. kernel-figure``: for figure handling / a ``.. figure::`` replacement

    * ``.. kernel-render``: for render markup / a concept to embed *render*
      markups (or languages). Supported markups (see ``RENDER_MARKUP_EXT``)

      - ``DOT``: render embedded Graphviz's **DOC**
      - ``SVG``: render embedded Scalable Vector Graphics (**SVG**)
      - ... *developable*

    Used tools:

    * ``dot(1)``: Graphviz (http://www.graphviz.org). If Graphviz is not
      available, the DOT language is inserted as literal-block.

    * SVG to PDF: To generate PDF, you need at least one of this tools:

      - ``convert(1)``: ImageMagick (https://www.imagemagick.org)

    List of customizations:

    * generate PDF from SVG / used by PDF (LaTeX) builder

    * generate SVG (html-builder) and PDF (latex-builder) from DOT files.
