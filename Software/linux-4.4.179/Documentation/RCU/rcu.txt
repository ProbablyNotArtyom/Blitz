AdvanSys (Advanced System Products, Inc.) manufactures the following
RISC-based, Bus-Mastering, Fast (10 Mhz) and Ultra (20 Mhz) Narrow
(8-bit transfer) SCSI Host Adapters for the ISA, EISA, VL, and PCI
buses and RISC-based, Bus-Mastering, Ultra (20 Mhz) Wide (16-bit
transfer) SCSI Host Adapters for the PCI bus.

The CDB counts below indicate the number of SCSI CDB (Command
Descriptor Block) requests that can be stored in the RISC chip
cache and board LRAM. A CDB is a single SCSI command. The driver
detect routine will display the number of CDBs available for each
adapter detected. The number of CDBs used by the driver can be
lowered in the BIOS by changing the 'Host Queue Size' adapter setting.

Driver Compile Time Options and Debugging

The following constants can be defined in the source file.

1. ADVANSYS_ASSERT - Enable driver assertions (Def: Enabled)

   Enabling this option adds assertion logic statements to the
   driver. If an assertion fails a message will be displayed to
   the console, but the system will continue to operate. Any
   assertions encountered should be reported to the person
   responsible for the driver. Assertion statements may proactively
   detect problems with the driver and facilitate fixing these
   problems. Enabling assertions will add a small overhead to the
   execution of the driver.

2. ADVANSYS_DEBUG - Enable driver debugging (Def: Disabled)

   Enabling this option adds tracing functions to the driver and the
   ability to set a driver tracing level at boot time.  This option is
   very useful for debugging the driver, but it will add to the size
   of the driver execution image and add overhead to the execution of
   the driver.

   The amount of debugging output can be controlled with the global
   variable 'asc_dbglvl'. The higher the number the more output. By
   default the debug level is 0.

   If the driver is loaded at boot time and the LILO Driver Option
   is included in the system, the debug level can be changed by
   specifying a 5th (ASC_NUM_IOPORT_PROBE + 1) I/O Port. The
   first three hex digits of the pseudo I/O Port must be set to
   'deb' and the fourth hex
