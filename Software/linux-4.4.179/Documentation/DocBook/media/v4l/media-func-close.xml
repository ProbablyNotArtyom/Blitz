Some warnings, first.

 * BIG FAT WARNING *********************************************************
 *
 * If you touch anything on disk between suspend and resume...
 *				...kiss your data goodbye.
 *
 * If you do resume from initrd after your filesystems are mounted...
 *				...bye bye root partition.
 *			[this is actually same case as above]
 *
 * If you have unsupported (*) devices using DMA, you may have some
 * problems. If your disk driver does not support suspend... (IDE does),
 * it may cause some problems, too. If you change kernel command line
 * between suspend and resume, it may do something wrong. If you change
 * your hardware while system is suspended... well, it was not good idea;
 * but it will probably only crash.
 *
 * (*) suspend/resume support is needed to make it safe.
 *
 * If you have any filesystems on USB devices mounted before software suspend,
 * they won't be accessible after resume and you may lose data, as though
 * you have unplugged the USB devices with mounted filesystems on them;
 * see the FAQ below for details.  (This is not true for more traditional
 * power states like "standby", which normally don't turn USB off.)

Swap partition:
You need to append resume=/dev/your_swap_partition to kernel command
line or specify it using /sys/power/resume.

Swap file:
If using a swapfile you can also specify a resume offset using
resume_offset=<number> on the kernel command line or specify it
in /sy
