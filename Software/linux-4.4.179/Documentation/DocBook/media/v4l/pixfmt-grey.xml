Linux voltage and current regulator framework
=============================================

About
=====

This framework is designed to provide a standard kernel interface to control
voltage and current regulators.

The intention is to allow systems to dynamically control regulator power output
in order to save power and prolong battery life. This applies to both voltage
regulators (where voltage output is controllable) and current sinks (where
current limit is controllable).

Nomenclature
============

Some terms used in this document:-

  o Regulator    - Electronic device that supplies power to other devices.
                   Most regulators can enable and disable their output whilst
                   some can control their output voltage and or current.

                   Input Voltage -> Regulator -> Output Voltage


  o PMIC         - Power Management IC. An IC that contains numerous regulators
                   and often contains other subsystems.


  o Consumer     - Electronic device that is supplied power by a regulator.
                   Consumers can be classified into two types:-

                   Static: consumer does not change its supply voltage or
                   current limit. It only needs to enable or disable its
                   power supply. Its supply voltage is set by the hardware,
                   bootloader, firmware or kernel board initialisation code.

                   Dynamic: consumer needs to change its supply voltage or
                   current limit to meet operation demands.


  o Power Domain - Electronic circuit that is supplied its input power by the
                   output power of a regulator, switch or by another power
                   domain.

                   The supply regulator may be behind a switch(s). i.e.

                   Regulator -+-> Switch-1 -+-> Switch-2 --> [Consumer A]
