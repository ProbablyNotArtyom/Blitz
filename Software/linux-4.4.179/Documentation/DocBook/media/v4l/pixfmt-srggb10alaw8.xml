can use it to adjust system clock time.

A PPS source can be connected to a serial port (usually to the Data
Carrier Detect pin) or to a parallel port (ACK-pin) or to a special
CPU's GPIOs (this is the common case in embedded systems) but in each
case when a new pulse arrives the system must apply to it a timestamp
