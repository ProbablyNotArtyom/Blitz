OpenRISC Linux
==============

This is a port of Linux to the OpenRISC class of microprocessors; the initial
target architecture, specifically, is the 32-bit OpenRISC 1000 family (or1k).

Build instructions for OpenRISC toolchain and Linux
===================================================

In order to build and run Linux for OpenRISC, you'll need at least a basic
toolchain and, perhaps, the architectural simulator.  Steps to get these bits
in place are outlined here.

1) Toolchain

Toolchain binaries can be obtained from openrisc.io or our github releases page.
Instructions for building the different toolchains can be found on openrisc.io
or Stafford's toolchain build and release scripts.

2) Building

Build the Linux kernel as usual

	make ARCH=openrisc defconfig
	make ARCH=openrisc

3) Running on FPGA (optional)

The OpenRISC community typically uses FuseSoC to manage building and programming
an SoC into an FPGA.  The below is an example of programming a De0 Nano
development board with the OpenRISC SoC.  During the build FPGA RTL is code
downloaded from the FuseSoC IP cores repository and built using the FPGA vendor
tools.  Binaries are loaded onto the board wi
