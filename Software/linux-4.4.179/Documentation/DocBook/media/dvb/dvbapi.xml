Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF)
====================================
The VRF device combined with ip rules provides the ability to create virtual
routing and forwarding domains (aka VRFs, VRF-lite to be specific) in the
Linux network stack. One use case is the multi-tenancy problem where each
tenant has their own unique routing tables and in the very least need
different default gateways.

Processes can be "VRF aware" by binding a socket to the VRF device. Packets
through the socket then use the routing table associated with the VRF
device. An important feature of the VRF device implementation is that it
impacts only Layer 3 and above so L2 tools (e.g., LLDP) are not affected
(ie., they do not need to be run in each VRF). The design also allows
the use of higher priority ip rules (Policy Based Routing, PBR) to take
precedence over the VRF device rules directing specific traffic as desired.

In addition, VRF devices allow VRFs to be nested within namespaces. For
example network namespaces provide separation of network interfaces at the
device layer, VLANs on the interfaces within a namespace provide L2 separation
and then VRF devices provide L3 separation.

Design
------
A VRF device is created with an associated route table. Network interfaces
are then enslaved to a VRF device:

         +-----------------------------+
         |           vrf-blue          |  ===> route table 10
         +-----------------------------+
            |        |            |
         +------+ +------+     +-------------+
         | eth1 | | eth2 | ... |    bond1    |
         +------+ +------+     +-------------+
                                  |       |
                              +------+ +------+
                              | eth8 | | eth9 |
                              +------+ +------+

Packets received on an enslaved device and are switched to the VRF device
in the IPv4 and IPv6 processing stacks giving the impression that packets
flow through the VRF device. Similarly on egress routing rules are used to
send packets to the VRF device driver before getting sent out the actual
interface. This allows tcpdump on a VRF device to capture all packets into
and out of the VRF as a whole.[1] Similarly, netfilter[2] and tc rules can be
applied using the VRF device to specify rules that apply to the VRF domain
as a whole.

[1] Packets in the forwarded state do not flow through the device, so those
    packets are not seen by tcpdump. Will revisit this limitation in a
    future release.

[2] Iptables on ingress supports PREROUTING with skb->dev set to the real
    ingress device and both INPUT and PREROUTING rules with skb->dev set to
    the VRF device. For egress POSTROUTING and OUTPUT rules can be written
    using either the VRF device or real egress device.

Setup
-----
1. VRF device is created with an association to a FIB table.
   e.g, ip link add vrf-blue type vrf table 10
        ip link set dev vrf-blue up

2. An l3mdev FIB rule directs lookups to the table associated with the device.
   A single l3mdev rule is sufficient for all VRFs. The VRF device adds the
   l3mdev rule for IPv4 and IPv6 when the first device is created with a
   default preference of 1000. Users may delete the rule if desired and add
   with a different priority or install per-VRF rules.

   Prior to the v4.8 kernel iif and oif rules are needed for each VRF device:
       ip ru add oif vrf-blue table 10
       ip ru add iif vrf-blue table 10

3. Set the default route for the table (and hence default route for the VRF).
       ip route add table 10 unreachable default metric 4278198272

   This high metric value ensures that the default unreachable route can
   be overridden by a routing protocol suite.  FRRouting interprets
   kernel metrics as a combined admin distance (upper byte) and priority
   (lower 3 bytes).  Thus the above metric translates to [255/8192].

4. Enslave L3 interfaces to a VRF device.
       ip link set dev eth1 master vrf-blue

   Local and connected routes for enslaved devices are automatically moved to
   the table associated with VRF device. Any additional routes depending on
   the enslaved de
