                        ISO7816 SERIAL COMMUNICATIONS

1. INTRODUCTION

  ISO/IEC7816 is a series of standards specifying integrated circuit cards (ICC)
  also known as smart cards.

2. HARDWARE-RELATED CONSIDERATIONS

  Some CPUs/UARTs (e.g., Microchip AT91) contain a built-in mode capable of
  handling communication with a smart card.

  For these microcontrollers, the Linux driver should be made capable of
  working in both modes, and proper ioctls (see later) should be made
  available at user-level to allow switching from one mode to the other, and
  vice versa.

3. DATA STRUCTURES ALREADY AVAILABLE IN THE KERNEL

  The Linux kernel provides the serial_iso7816 structure (see [1]) to handl
