SCTP SELinux Support
=====================

Security Hooks
===============

``Documentation/security/LSM-sctp.rst`` describes the following SCTP security
hooks with the SELinux specifics expanded below::

    security_sctp_assoc_request()
    security_sctp_bind_connect()
    security_sctp_sk_clone()
    security_inet_conn_established()


security_sctp_assoc_request()
-----------------------------
Passes the ``@ep`` and ``@chunk->skb`` of the association INIT packet to the
security module. Returns 0 on success, error on failure.
::

    @ep - pointer to sctp endpoint structure.
    @skb - pointer to skbuff of association packet.

The security module performs the following operations:
     IF this is the first association on ``@ep->base.sk``, then set the peer
     sid to that in ``@skb``. This will ensure there is only one peer sid
     assigned to ``@ep->base.sk`` that may support multiple associations.

     ELSE validate the ``@ep->base.sk peer_sid`` against the ``@skb peer sid``
     to determine whether the association should be allowed or denied.

     Set the sctp ``@ep sid`` to socket's sid (from ``ep->base.sk``) with
     MLS portion taken from ``@skb peer sid``. This will be
