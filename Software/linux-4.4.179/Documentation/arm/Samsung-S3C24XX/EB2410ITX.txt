BASICS

The driver is generic, i.e., it does not contain any code tailored
to any specific tape drive. The tape parameters can be specified with
one of the following three methods:

1. Each user can specify the tape parameters he/she wants to use
directly with ioctls. This is administratively a very simple and
flexible method and applicable to single-user workstations. However,
in a multiuser environment the next user finds the tape parameters in
state the previous user left them.

2. The system manager (root) can define default values for some tape
parameters, like block size and density using the MTSETDRVBUFFER ioctl.
These parameters can be programmed to come into effect either when a
new tape is loaded into the drive or if writing begins at the
beginning of the tape. The second method is applicable if the tape
drive performs auto-detection of the tape format well (like some
QIC-drives). The result is that any tape can be read, writing can be
continued using existing format, and the default format is used if
the tape is rewritten from the beginning (or a new tape is written
for the first time). The first method is applicable if the drive
does not perform auto-detection well enough and there
