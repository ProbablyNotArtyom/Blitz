Introduction
============
This file documents the features and components of the SCSI FC Transport.
It also provides documents the API between the transport and FC LLDDs.
The FC transport can be found at:

Overview:
-------------------------------

  New FC standards have defined mechanisms which allows for a single physical
  port to appear on as multiple communication ports. Using the N_Port Id
  Virtualization (NPIV) mechanism, a point-to-point connection to a Fabric
  can be assigned more than 1 N_Port_ID.  Each N_Port_ID appears as a
  separate port to other endpoints on the fabric, even though it shares one
  physical link to the switch for communication. Each N_Port_ID can have a
  unique view of the fabric based on fabric zoning and array lun-masking
  (just like a normal non-NPIV adapter).  Using the Virtual Fabric (VF)
  mechanism, adding a fabric header to each frame allows the port to
  interact with the Fabric Port to join multiple fabrics. The port will
  obtain an N_Port_ID on each fabric it joins. Each fabric will have its
  own unique view of endpoints and configuration parameters.  NPIV may be
  used together with VF so that the port can obtain mult
