Low latency, multichannel audio with JACK and the emu10k1/emu10k2
=================================================================

This document is a guide to using the emu10k1 based devices with JACK for low
latency, multichannel recording functionality.  All of my recent work to allow
Linux users to use the full capabilities of their hardware has been inspired 
by the kX Project.  Without their work I never would have discovered the true
power of this hardware.

Until recently, emu10k1 users on Linux did not have access to the same low
latency, multichannel features offered by the "kX ASIO" feature of their
Windows driver.  As of ALSA 1.0.9 this is no more!

For those unfamiliar with kX ASIO, this consists of 16 capture and 16 playback
channels.  With a post 2.6.9 Linux kernel, latencies down to 64 (1.33 ms) or
even 32 (0.66ms) frames should work well.

The configuration is slightly more involved than on
