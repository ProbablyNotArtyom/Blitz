=======================================
Software Interface ALSA-DSP MADI Driver 
=======================================

(translated from German, so no good English ;-), 

2004 - winfried ritsch


Full functionality has been added to the driver. Since some of
the Controls and startup-options  are ALSA-Standard and only the
special Controls are described and discussed below.


Hardware functionality
======================
   
Audio transmission
------------------

* number of channels --  depends on transmission mode

		The number of channels chosen is from 1..Nmax. The reason to
		use for a lower number of channels is only resource allocation,
		since unused DMA channels are disabled and less memory is
		allocated. So also the throughput of the PCI system can be
		scaled. (Only important for low performance boards).

* Single Speed -- 1..64 channels 

.. note::
		 (Note: Choosing the 56channel mode for transmission or as
		 receiver, only 56 are transmitted/received over the MADI, but
		 all 64 channels are available for the mixer, so channel count
		 for the driver)

* Double Speed -- 1..32 channels

.. note::
		 Note: Choosing the 56-channel mode for
		 transmission/receive-mode , only 28 are transmitted/received
		 over the MADI, but all 32 channels are available for the mixer,
		 so channel count for the driver


* Quad Speed -- 1..16 channels 

.. note::
		 Choosing the 56-channel mode for
		 transmission/receive-mode , only 14 are transmitted/received
		 over the MADI, but all 16 channels are available for the mixer,
		 so channel count for the driver

* Format -- signed 32 Bit Little Endian (SNDRV_PCM_FMTBIT_S32_LE)

* Sample Rates --

       Single Speed -- 32000, 44100, 48000

       Double Speed -- 64000, 88200, 96000 (untested)
