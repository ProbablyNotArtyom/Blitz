Overview
========
Since its early days, the ALSA API was defined with PCM support or
constant bitrates payloads such as IEC61937 in mind. Arguments and
returned values in frames are the norm, making it a challenge to
extend the existing API to compressed data streams.

In recent years, audio digital signal processors (DSP) were integrated
in system-on-chip designs, and DSPs are also integrated in audio
codecs. Processing compressed data on such DSPs results in a dramatic
reduction of power consumption compared to host-based
processing. Support for such hardware has not been very good in Linux,
mostly because of a lack of a generic API available in the mainline
kernel.

Rather than requiring a compatibility break with an API change of the
ALSA PCM interface, a new 'Compressed Data' API is introduced to
provide a control and data-streaming interface for audio DSPs.

The design of this API was inspired by the 2-year experience with the
Intel Moorestown SOC, with many corrections required to upstream the
API in the mainline kernel instead of the staging tree and make it
usable by others.
