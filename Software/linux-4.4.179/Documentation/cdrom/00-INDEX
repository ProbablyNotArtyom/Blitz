ASoC Machine Driver
===================

The ASoC machine (or board) driver is the code that glues together all the
component drivers (e.g. codecs, platforms and DAIs). It also describes the
relationships between each component which include audio paths, GPIOs,
interrupts, clocking, jacks and voltage regulators.
