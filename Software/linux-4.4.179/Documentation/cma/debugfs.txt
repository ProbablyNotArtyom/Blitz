Description
-----------
This driver provides glue code connecting a National Semiconductor LM70 LLP
temperature sensor evaluation board to the kernel's SPI core subsystem.

This is a SPI master controller driver. It can be used in conjunction with
(layered under) the LM70 logical driver (a "SPI protocol driver").
In effect, this driver turns the parallel port interface on the eval board
into a SPI bus with a single device, which will be driven by the generic
LM70 driver (drivers/hwmon/lm70.c).
