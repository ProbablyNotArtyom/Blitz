Introduction
------------

Ftrace is an internal tracer designed to help out developers and
designers of systems to find what is going on inside the kernel.
It can be used for debugging or analyzing latencies and
performance issues that take place outside of user-space.

Although ftrace is typically considered the function tracer, it
is really a frame work of several assorted tracing utilities.
There's latency tracing to examine what occurs between interrupts
disabled and enabled, as well as for preemption and from a time
a task is woken to the task is actually scheduled in.

One of the most common uses of ftrace is the event tracing.
Through out the kernel is hundreds of static event points that
can be enabled via the tracefs file system to see what is
going on in certain parts of the kernel.

See events.txt for more information.


Implementation Details
----------------------

See :doc:`ftrace-design` for details for arch porters and such.


The File System
---------------

Ftrace uses the tracefs file system to hold the control files as
well as the files to display output.

When tracefs is configured into the kernel (which selecting any ftrace
option will do) the directory /sys/kernel/tracing will be created. To mount
this directory, you can add to your /etc/fstab file::

 tracefs       /sys/kernel/tracing       tracefs defaults
