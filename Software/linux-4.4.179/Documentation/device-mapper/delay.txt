Introduction
------------

Here we will cover the architecture pieces that the common function tracing
code relies on for proper functioning.  Things are broken down into increasing
complexity so that you can start simple and at least get basic functionality.

Note that this focuses on architecture implementation details only.  If you
want more explanation of a feature in terms of common code, review the common
ftrace.txt file.

Ideally, everyone who wishes to retain performance while supporting tracing in
the
