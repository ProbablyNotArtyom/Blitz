 * These macros are intended for use when there is a need to copy a low-level
 * function body into special memory.
 *
 * For example, when reconfiguring the SDRAM controller, the code doing the
 * reconfiguration may need to run from SRAM.
 *
 * NOTE: that the copied function body must be entirely self-contained and
 * position-independent in order for this to work properly.
 *
 * NOTE: in order for embedded literals and data to get referenced correctly,
 * the alignment of functions must be preserved when copying.  To ensure this,
 * the source and destination addresses for fncpy() must be aligned to a
 * multiple of 8 bytes: you w
